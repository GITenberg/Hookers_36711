<h2>"FOREWORD"</h2>


<p>In writing this preface, it seems that I have
followed the old Mexican custom of "Manana,"
and waited until the book was finished, before
writing it, then I discovered that it was a
necessity.</p>

<p>The characters in this story are real, live, and
living people, and most of them are still in the fair
city of Juarez, plying the oldest trade in the
world, and were known personally by the
Author, who studied them for several months in
pop-eyed amazement.</p>

<p>All of the incidents in this story actually happened,
and are taken right from the bare facts of
life; in fact, the Author has had to tone down
some of the descriptions of the parties herein
mentioned.</p>

<p>The Author has not meant to be vicious in his
statements of either country, but has merely
stated conditions as they were found.</p>

"You lousy bastard, don't you ever set foot in
this room again. You sure got nerve&mdash;accusing
me of holding out on you&mdash;you know damn well
that guy never paid me a cent."</p>

<p>"Well, Pearl, how was I to know? He came
down into the street, and said that he gave you
two bucks."</p>

<p>"As long as you've been a Pimp, you should
fall for that stuff&mdash;Screw&mdash;get out of my sight."</p>

<p>"O.&nbsp;K. Baby, but remember that if you ever
need me, all you gotta do is just say the word.
You know I'm all for you."</p>

<p>"Nuts&mdash;I've been in this burg a week, and all
I done is turn Two Dollar tricks, and split with
you, and for what? You ain't never brought me
one dime, but you sure ain't missed any meals.
I don't need you or any other guy from now on.
I got my permit today from the Chief of Police
of Juarez, to hustle all I want on the Mex side,
and I'm doing it, starting tonight."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One week had passed since the person of Pearl
Jones had stepped off the west-bound Texas &amp;
Pacific train in El Paso, with one thought in mind,
and that to make as much money as possible in as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
short a time as possible, and without bother from
the police if&mdash;possible, which is not POSSIBLE,
even in a border town like El Paso, as Pearl had
already found out.</p>

<p>In order for Pearl to hustle on the Mexican
side of the border in the City of Juarez, it was
absolutely necessary that she have a written permit
from the Chief of Police, or any official whom
she happened to please in the usual way that a
girl of her ilk had to please one, when there wasn't
enough money in the pocket to buy the permit.
Consequently, Pearl found out later she could
have had a permit from the most lowly Immigration
official to the Mayor himself, but in the midst
of her efforts to please, the Chief of Police seemed
to be the one who was affected quickest in her
efforts to&mdash;please&mdash;. Hence the permit.</p>

<p>Juarez, Mexico, chief port of entry to Mexico,
population of forty thousand souls, mostly lost
ones, separated from the United States by the
Rio Grande River, if it may have the luck to be
called a river, which at no time is deep enough to
wet the crucial spot of one's anatomy, in case one
has to run through it owing to lack of time to
make the bridge, which has often been the case.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
"Well, this is a night for celebration," thought
Pearl, as she left her hotel to walk down to the
corner of Stanton Street, to catch the Juarez car.
The car was filled from door to door with old
Mexican women, wrapped in black shawls, which
would have been black with dirt had they been
originally any other color, and loaded down with
topping bags filled with the bare necessities that
their own Immigration was kind enough to let
them bring in, and anything else that they might
hide under the numerous dirty underskirts they
might happen to have on.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The car clanged, and slowly started its noisy
journey toward the Stanton Street Bridge, at
which it stopped from three to five minutes, for
the Mexican Immigration and Customs Officials
to go through the car and make a pretense at
examining everything that was being brought into
Mexico, as if anything on the face of God's green
earth that was brought into Mexico could hurt it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"I wonder where I'll get off, now that I'm over
here," thought Pearl, as the car left the bridge to
ramble on its way on into the heart of Juarez,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
which is the sixteenth of September St. "I know,"
she thought, "I'll get off at the Tivoli, where all
the gambling is, and see if I have any luck there."</p>

<p>"Hello, Honey," came the friendly voice of a
heavy-set woman of about thirty, who five years
before had been the toast of the border because
of her beauty, but who now had begun to show
what the excess of Men, Beer and Hook Shops,
too numerous to mention, can do to a woman who
had sold herself to any man with the price, and
had given herself just as quickly to a man whom
she thought she liked. "I saw you over here last
night and wondered who you were. Did you just
come to town? Well, my name is Evelyn&mdash;the
last name don't matter, but better known as Bar
Fly Ev. I'll be glad to show you the ropes around
here. Come on and let's get off here at the Tivoli
and snatch a couple of shots of whiskey, and see
if there's a dollar to be made here. Of course, it's
a little early just yet. The best time to pick a live
guy is about an hour before the bridge closes tonight,
that's when they are looking for a girl to
spend the night with, and they ain't too particular.
That's how I manage. Of course, you won't
have to do that&mdash;you're too fresh
looking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>&mdash;they'll
go for you like a Texas hog goes for swill."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Tivoli, the official gambling house of
Juarez with any kind of a game you care to play,
run square, but with the percentage so heavy for
the house that a winning customer is a scarce
thing.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Say, Ev, did you have to get a permit when
you came to this town, before you could hustle
on this side?" asked Pearl.</p>

<p>"Hell, no, that's a lot of dirty gippery. The
only permit I've got is the one that every woman
has. Of course, I know what you have had to go
through, and it's a damn shame that some louse
didn't tip you off. That's the way them Mex's
have of getting first pop at every girl that comes
down here."</p>

<p>"What'll you girls have?" asked the bartender.</p>

<p>"Whiskey for me, Joe. What will you have,
Dearie?"</p>

<p>"The same, and a big one," answered Pearl.</p>

<p>"Say, Dearie, by what name are you calling
yourself?"</p>

<p>"Excuse me for not telling you before, but it's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
Pearl&mdash;Pearl Jones&mdash;let's have another drink on
it.</p>

<p>"Well, that's as good a name as any, at least,
it's good and common," smiled Evelyn, as she
killed her second drink without a chaser.</p>

<p>"You know the old saying, 'Common by name,
common by nature.'"</p>

<p>"I'm damned if you ain't O.&nbsp;K., and we'll have
another drink on that one. Hey, Joe, two more
drinks for two ladies."</p>

<p>"Say, Ev, you must have something on your
mind tonight the way you are starting off. You
girls have a drink on the house, will you?"</p>

<p>"Hell, Yes&mdash;I'll drink on anything. You know
me, Joe&mdash;Bar Fly Ev, the girl without a limit&mdash;at
anything. By the way, Joe, this is Pearl. She's a
new girl in town."</p>

<p>"Hello, Sister, glad to know you. Have another
drink."</p>

<p>"I'm glad to know you, and Ev and I will have
another drink, possibly several more," answered
Pearl, displaying her best smile.</p>

<p>"Say, Sister, you're dern good looking. I'd
like to see more of you," said Joe, as he poured
more whiskey, and leaned over the bar and patted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
Pearl on the arm. "I'm O.&nbsp;K. You ask Ev if I
ain't. How about it, Ev?"</p>

<p>"I'll say you're O.&nbsp;K., Joe, and you've spent
many a dollar on me, but Jees, you're seventy
years old if you're a day. Don't you ever get too
old for this sort of thing?"</p>

<p>"You'll have to ask somebody older than I am,"
answered Joe.</p>

<p>"Don't let her kid you, Joe," smiled Pearl, "You
and I will get together real soon, how's that?"</p>

<p>"Here, here, here&mdash;you two, let's don't have
an exhibition on such short notice. We gotta be
moving along. We got a lot of hard drinking to
do tonight, as well as a few dollars to earn."</p>

<p>"Oh, Ev, don't be in no hurry. You and Pearl
have another drink on the house."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I guess we better have another little
one before we go, eh, Pearl?"</p>

<p>"Sure, Ev. I'd as soon get lit here with Joe,
as later. Makes no difference by me."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Joe poured the drinks, and one for himself.
"Here's how," said Joe, as he poured his down.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
"We'll be seeing you," waved Ev, as they
started for the door.</p>

<p>"Let's see&mdash;seeing that we're on this side of
the street, we might as well go to the Gold Palace.
It's only four or five doors down this way."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Gold Palace, a large cabaret, with a balcony
on one side, the dance floor surrounded by
tables and chairs with their real ugliness covered
with dirty green covers, of none too certain age,
with a band stand at the far end of the place, the
bar off to the right doing a rushing business.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"We might as well go in here and cop a couple
of snorts of liquor, and see if there's any of the
girls in yet," said Ev, as she started for the bar.</p>

<p>"Hello, Curley&mdash;my, you look grand tonight,"
Ev greeted the young bartender, as they stood up
to the rail. "I want you to meet one of the new
girls who just came to town. Curley, this is
Pearl."</p>

<p>"Hello, Pearl&mdash;I'm always glad to meet a new
girl. Now, what will you have to drink?"</p>

<p>"Whiskey for me," said Pearl, "what do you
want, Ev?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
"Whiskey, and lots of it, Curley," answered
Ev.</p>

<p>"Say, for cripes sake," said Pearl under her
breath, "who is that kid? Jees, he's cute. I've
been in here several times, and every time I've
seen him, I get all worked up over him."</p>

<p>"Cool thyself, Sister, it will doith thee no good
to workith thyself into a lather about him. The
old jane who owns this joint&mdash;well, her daughter
married him. That's why he is working here, and
is true to the wife, maybe not because he wants
to be, but because he'd better be, or else lose a
certain section of his anatomy which would cause
him to be of no further use to anyone&mdash;ssshhh&mdash;here
he comes with the drinks, I'll tell you more
later. How is your wife, Curley?" smiled Ev.</p>

<p>"She's fine," answered Curley, as he went to
wait on other customers.</p>

<p>"Well, as I was saying&mdash;the old jane who owns
this place is Grace Valdez&mdash;no, she ain't Mex, but
when she came down here about ten years ago
she married one, in order to become a Mex citizen,
so she could run a chain of hook-shops without
any bother from the Mex government. Grace,
at one time, was the biggest Madam in Denver,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
Colorado&mdash;but she's a good scout. If you're in a
jam and she likes you, she can do you a lot of
good; in fact, she can keep any girl out of this
town that she don't like. I'll introduce you to
her tonight, if she comes around. That's why I'm
putting you hep&mdash;don't go on the make for the
Son-in-Law. Hey, Curley, give me and Pearl another
whiskey."</p>

<p>"O.&nbsp;K. Ev, drinks coming up."</p>

<p>"Don't be funny, Ev. I made five bucks off him
yesterday afternoon."</p>

<p>"Oh, Jees&mdash;" exclaimed Evelyn, with her eyes
bulging, "Well, for the love of your own soul,
don't let on to any of these other hookers, as they
are sure to run to Grace with it, and Hell would
break loose in a big way&mdash;but&mdash;I'm curious, is&mdash;I
mean&mdash;is,&mdash;well,&mdash;how the Hell is his bed manners?
I'm curious to know if the wife is getting
a break, considering all the fun her Mother has
had."</p>

<p>"Oh, Ev, he's&mdash;well&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ssshh, pipe down, here comes Grace now.
Hello, Grace, dear, how are you?" smiled Evelyn
sweetly, "I got a friend here who is just dying to
meet you, Gracie, dear."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
"Hello, Ev," answered Grace, as she walked up
to the two.</p>

<p>"Grace, dear, this is Pearl Jones. She just came
to town, and I'm kinda showing her the sights
tonight."</p>

<p>"How are you, Pearl," said Grace, as she offered
her hand to Pearl.</p>

<p>"I'm glad to know you, Grace; won't you have
a drink with us?"</p>

<p>"I've just got time enough to have a drink,
then I've got to get out to the Red Lights Apartments.
Three of my girls got into a fight last
night, and one got stabbed pretty bad."</p>

<p>"What was the fight over&mdash;a man?" asked Ev.</p>

<p>"Sure&mdash;that's always the cause of fights down
there. One of the girls was caught with the other
one's man," said Grace, as she threw her whiskey
down, "I'm glad to have met you, Pearl. If I
can be of any help to you any time, don't be afraid
to call on me. So long, Ev," and with that Grace
disappeared in the crowd.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Say, Ev, I like that old dame."</p>

<p>"I knew you would&mdash;she's a pip&mdash;that is, as
long as you don't cross her. Well, let's shove off
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
from here. There's a lot of bars over on Lysol
Lane we ain't been into yet."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Juarez Avenue, better known as Lysol Lane,
extends from the Sixteenth of September Street to
the Santa Fe Bridge, and all traffic, pedestrian and
otherwise, must go down this street and across
this bridge to return to El Paso, as both bridges
are one way, the Stanton Street Bridge is to enter
Juarez, and the Santa Fe Bridge to leave it. This
street, being a little over half a mile long, even if
you were sober when you start down it, you would
be drunk when you reached the bridge, as more
than every other door is a famous bar, others infamous&mdash;but
bars nevertheless, and as you near
the bridge they are bigger and better and louder
and wilder. So the girls started their trek down
this street with the Barrel House, then to several
bars of less importance, until they reached the
Castle, which is known for its wonderful band,
its good liquor, and its wonderful proprietor and
his wife, who, when she has been drinking a little
too much, does a strip dance on the floor that
causes the Cholos to fly for the river, to keep from
burning the seats out of their pants.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
"Hi, everybody," yelled Evelyn, as she threw
the swinging doors open and strode in. "I crave
whiskey and lots of it. Come on, Pearl, the night
is just beginning&mdash;Everybody, this is Pearl, a
friend of mine I've known for years&mdash;come on,
everybody, drink to her&mdash;W-h-ee-ee," screamed
Evelyn, throwing her arms around the nearest
man, and everybody moving and milling around
the bar. The band in the cabaret struck up a hot
number, with everybody screaming and dancing
and drinking, for the night was starting its mad,
hilarious orgy, which always ended with anyone
going to bed with anyone they happened to be
with, regardless of who it might happen to be,
sometimes even their own husbands.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Pearl found herself swept along by strong arms,
on to the dance floor, before she had time to see
his face, and when she did get a real look at him,
she wasn't displeased. He was a tall fellow, about
twenty-five or less, in laced boots, riding pants
and leather sport jacket, and grey slouch hat.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"I'm hot for you, baby; I could use you plenty,"
were his first words to Pearl.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
"Well, you're not hard to take."</p>

<p>"That will be for you to decide later," he smiled
with his eyes.</p>

<p>"My car is parked just back of this place. Shall
we go out to it, or would you rather go elsewhere?"</p>

<p>"Your car is as good a place as any&mdash;let's go."</p>

<p>"Oke," he answered, as he put his arm around
her waist and lifted her off her feet and carried
her out of the crowd to the swinging door. "How
much is this deal going to cost me, Baby?"</p>

<p>"Just five bucks, big boy."</p>

<p>"Oke, Baby," as he slipped a bill into her hand,
"There's ten. If you're good for five, you ought
to be a pip for that."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the dim light Pearl uncrumpled the bill he
had slipped into her hand.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Nuts, big boy, what's the gag? This ain't no
ten&mdash;this is a fifty."</p>

<p>"I know it&mdash;see if you can make the next fifteen
minutes worth it."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The band played wild, hot, throbbing, beating,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
maddening, breath-taking, passionate music, while
the crowd swayed in and out, and around. Young
men whispered soft, sweet words. Old men whispered
soft, sweet words. Young and innocent ears
listened and remembered. Not so young and less
innocent ears heard, still they did not hear. Hands
of young men strayed over their partner's bodies.
Hands of old men strayed over their partners.
Young and innocent figures quivered, and whispered,
"Darling, I love you," while less young,
and less innocent said, "Get your hand off my
Pratt."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Evelyn looked around all the faces that were
near her, but nowhere could she see Pearl. She
ordered more drinks while she waited, knowing
from experience that if a girl friend disappeared
for a few minutes there was only one thing to do,
and that was to&mdash;wait. There was no need for
hurry&mdash;wasn't she drinking all she could hold,
and it wasn't costing her a cent? Sure, she would
wait&mdash;till Hell froze over&mdash;or at least till whoever
was buying the drinks, stopped.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"For the love of Jees&mdash;where the Hell you
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
been? Look at your face&mdash;my God, but you need
a drink, dear," said Evelyn, as Pearl and her boy
friend came alongside the bar.</p>

<p>"Excuse us for a minute, big boy," said Pearl,
as she took Evelyn by the arm and started for the
Ladies' Room.</p>

<p>"You ain't answered my question, where&mdash;have
you been?"</p>

<p>"I just made some real money&mdash;look." She
showed Evelyn the fifty-dollar bill.</p>

<p>"Well, if you was out with that guy that you
came in with, all I got to say is&mdash;you damn sure
earned it."</p>

<p>"Ev, you said it&mdash;I ain't so sure I care to meet
any more like him, at least not tonight, although
I gave him my address. He wants to come up
tomorrow. What do you know about him, Ev?"</p>

<p>"Plenty&mdash;dearie&mdash;plenty, and if you can put up
with him you can have the world with a dirty
shirt on it. He is filthy with money, owns a mine
back out here in the mountains&mdash;you use your
own judgment, dearie."</p>

<p>"Were you ever out with him, Ev?"</p>

<p>"No, thanks, I bar horses."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
The crowds were beginning to work their way
down to the bridge district. All the bars were
full of hard-drinking men and women. The cabarets
were crowded, as it was time for the floor
shows to go on in these places.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Come on, Pearl, let's go over across the street
to the Lobby No. 2. It's a gay place, they have a
good show there, and there must be some of the
regular girls over there by now, and you've made
enough tonight already to spend the rest of the
night having a good time."</p>

<p>"All right, I'm ready."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Lobby No. 2, one of the most popular bars in
Juarez, the bar in the front of the building, and
the cabaret directly back of it, quite a large dance
floor, with a band stand at the farthest end, and
surrounded on three sides with tables, and every
table filled with every specie of the human race,
some drunk, some more drunk, and some blind
drunk.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Hello, there, Ev," greeted the bartender.
"How's the old girl tonight?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
"I'm fine, Henry&mdash;I want you to meet a girl
friend of mine. This is Pearl."</p>

<p>"Hi, Pearl, what will you and Ev have to
drink?"</p>

<p>"I think I'll have Rock and Rye, and a big slug
of it&mdash;Ev, speed up, you're holding up the
parade."</p>

<p>"Whiskey, my darlings&mdash;Hey, Harry&mdash;you
damn good-looking bastard&mdash;come over here, I
got a girl friend I want you to know."</p>

<p>"Why, hello, Ev&mdash;I haven't seen you in days,
or I mean nights. Where have you been?" greeted
Harry Hicks, a tall blonde young man of about
twenty-three, who was the Master of Ceremonies
of the floor show.</p>

<p>"Harry, this is Pearl&mdash;Pearl, this is Harry."
Evelyn poured down her whiskey without further
ado.</p>

<p>"How do you do," said Harry, as he offered
his hand.</p>

<p>"I'm very glad to know you," said Pearl, as
she took the offered hand.</p>

<p>"How soon does the show go on, Harry?" asked
Evelyn as she wiped her mouth on the back of
her hand.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
"In about three minutes, come on in and see it.
I've got a good table for you near the band."</p>

<p>"I'd love to," said Pearl, as Harry took her by
the arm and helped her through the crowd.</p>

<p>"Hello, there, Irene," Evelyn greeted a girl
friend, "How's tricks tonight?"</p>

<p>"Lousy," answered Irene. "I ain't made but
two dollars all day, but thank Heavens, tomorrow
is pay day at Fort Bliss, the soldiers are coming,
tra&mdash;la&mdash;la&mdash;la&mdash;la."</p>

<p>"See you later," called Evelyn, as she shoved
her way into the cabaret, and on down to the
table where Harry had seated Pearl.</p>

<p>"Say, Ev, that boy is a perfect darling&mdash;gee, he
is sweet, so fresh and clean looking."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;Yes&mdash;Yes&mdash;my dear, every Bat in this
town has said them same words, and I been unlucky
enough to be at every saying."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;good&mdash;there goes the show&mdash;look, Ev,
the way he announces, isn't he the cutest thing?"</p>

<p>"Yeah&mdash;I suppose you've made a date with
him tonight to meet at the States Cafe after you
get back on the U.&nbsp;S. side, and he is to take you
for a ride in his brother's car, and show you the
Rim road on Mount Franklin, and how the lights
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
of El Paso glitter down in the distance."</p>

<p>"Why, Ev&mdash;how did you know?"</p>

<p>"Dearest girl, he has only told that same line
to five thousand other Hookers in this man's burg,
and what's more, they all go for it&mdash;I don't for
the life of me know what it is about him that gets
all the girls going&mdash;but do they go&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Did he ever tell you that, Ev?"</p>

<p>"Heaven forbid&mdash;there's only one thing that
Harry could make me do, and that's&mdash;puke."</p>

<p>"Oh, Ev, look at the way he sings that song&mdash;why,
I think he is about the sweetest thing I've
seen down here."</p>

<p>"Pearl, dear, don't you let my dislikes bother
you. If you like him, you go for him. You see, I
been in this town for a long time, and when you
have been here as long as I have, you will hate
every Son-of-a-Bitch, and all that goes with them.
Don't pay any attention to my rants&mdash;Hey,
waiter&mdash;bring us two whiskeys, and for Heaven's
sake, make it pronto, I'm dead of thirst already."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The show went on, to a solid success, as it did
every night. It was eleven thirty, the band went
wild, so did everybody else. There was only thirty
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
minutes left to drink in, before the bridge closed
for the night. Everyone was making the most
of it.</p>

<p>Evelyn and Pearl finally worked their way back
to the bar, where Evelyn ordered a pint of whiskey,
and killed the whole thing without taking it
down from her lips.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Jees, am I gonna get drunk tonight&mdash;make it
another pint, Henry&mdash;pronto," yelled Evelyn.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Pearl and Harry were wrapped in each other's
arms, conscious of nothing around them, living
for the night only.</p>

<p>The States Cafe, the rendezvous for the continuation
of the gaiety after one has come on the
American side, not a large place by any means,
but serving good food, with no hindrance whatsoever
for the noise and ribaldry of the crowd, and
took no notice of the bottles of straight American
whiskey that appeared as if by magic out of the
ladies' bosoms, where they had been concealed
while in Juarez. The crowd had just begun to
come in when Evelyn and Pearl arrived.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>"Let's get a booth, Ev, and save a seat for
Harry, as he ought to be here soon."</p>

<p>"Sure, grab a booth&mdash;but there is no need of
saving a seat for Harry, he's already here," said
Evelyn, as Harry put his arms around Pearl from
behind.</p>

<p>"Oh, Harry, dear, I had no idea you would be
here so soon," said Pearl, happily, "Sit here, dear."</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you, Ev," asked
Harry, "haven't you a boy friend tonight?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, I've had a boy friend for the past
twenty-four hours, but he's up in my room, trying
to sober up enough to go home. He is a louse to
his wife&mdash;but&mdash;damn&mdash;he's good to me. He paid
my rent for a month, and opened me a charge
account at the White House, and gives me twenty
bucks a month."</p>

<p>"Don't this place have but the one waiter for
all these people?" asked Pearl.</p>

<p>"Just the one dear; Frank is his name, and he
takes his time, but he's a good scout&mdash;wait, I'll
go and get you some water&mdash;gee, but you are
sweet. Boy&mdash;oh&mdash;boy, I'd love to cut you," said
Harry, as he kissed her on the ear and went for
the water.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
"Good Lord, Ev, did you hear what he said&mdash;he
must be a sadist."</p>

<p>"No, I think Harry's Irish."</p>

<p>"But he said he would love to cut me."</p>

<p>"Well, dear, that expression has more definitions
than the one you happen to know," said
Evelyn. "My God, look who's here&mdash;if it ain't
Mickey and Betty&mdash;for the love of Heaven, where
have you two been for the past rear-end of the
week?"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Betty and Mickey came over to the table, hellos
and greetings were very much in order, loud,
noisy, raucous, but good natured was the dirty
banter that passed to and fro among the crowd.
Finally they left Pearl and Evelyn, but not until
they made Pearl promise to pay them a visit, then
they squeezed into a booth with four other people,
but where they could still see everybody, and
shout ribald songs of the border at the top of their
voices.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"What is the matter with Mickey's face? Why,
Ev, she looks like she had been through nine wars,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
and fought them all herself. I've never seen so
many scars."</p>

<p>"Well, you see," explained Evelyn, "Mickey is
the only woman in Juarez, or the world, for that
matter, that&mdash;if a fight starts in Juarez, and she
is on the U.&nbsp;S. side&mdash;she is sure to get into the
fight before it is over. I've seen her with a bottle
so deep in her skull it looked like a feather."</p>

<p>"Darling," said Harry, "My brother loaned me
his car, just as I told you. Shall we take a little
ride when you are through eating?"</p>

<p>"I'd love to, dear&mdash;I've never been riding
around El Paso since I've been here, but where
will we go?"</p>

<p>"Well, we could drive out the Smelter Road
and back the Mesa way, or we could go up on
Rim Road, on the side of Mount Franklin, or
maybe you would like to drive out to Washington
Park&mdash;it is beautiful at night."</p>

<p>"Well, if I were you," said Evelyn, "I'd go to
Washington Park. At least, there's grass on the
ground around there."</p>

<p>"Well, why isn't there grass on the ground in
the other places Harry mentioned, Ev?"</p>

<p>"Well, you see, as far as I know&mdash;I believe the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
natives of El Paso have had something to do with
the wearing off of the grass in said places."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know," smiled Pearl, "You mean cows."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;some cows, but mostly heifers."</p>

<p>"How do you girls feel about a drink," asked
Harry.</p>

<p>"Well, why the Hell didn't you say something
before&mdash;good Heavens, it's been a long time between
drinks&mdash;bottoms up."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Screaming, glasses crashing, curses, tearing of
clothes, yells, biting, pulling of hair, turning over
of tables, running of people, came from the rear
of the place.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Good Heavens," screamed Pearl, "Those
women are tearing each other to pieces&mdash;why
don't somebody try to separate them?"</p>

<p>"Come on, let's get going," said Harry, as he
took Pearl by the arm and piloted her out of the
place, never bothering to pay the check.</p>

<p>"So long, kids, I'll see you tomorrow," called
Evelyn.</p>

<p>"But where do you live, Ev?"</p>

<p>"San Antonio Apartments, on San Antonio
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
Street, number twenty-seven. Come up tomorrow,
dear&mdash;adios."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Harry and Pearl went out into the beautiful
new car, and took a long ride toward the Smelter
Road, to the fork where you return by the Mesa
Road.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Shall we stop and look at the moon for a
while?" asked Harry.</p>

<p>"I'd love it."</p>

<p>"Then we'll stop."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Harry pulled the car off the road at the top
of a small Mesa Butte, and turned off the lights.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Isn't it beautiful here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but you are more beautiful than a thousand
nights," whispered Harry into her ear.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>She turned her head, looked into his expectant
eyes, and thought how handsome he was, with
that tightly brushed blonde hair, bushy eyebrows,
beautiful smile, backed by manly big white teeth,
surrounded by red lips.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
"Oh, Harry, you are a darling," as their lips
met and their young bodies quivered with the
thrill of expectation to be fulfilled.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>El Paso, city of one hundred thousand, not
counting the nearby towns and villages. Noon,
the sun maddening with its terrific heat, asphalt
in the street so soft that your foot-print is left in
it on crossing, only the business that has to be
done is all that is going on. People move about
lifelessly, clothes sticking to them. Mexicans,
dressed in black, with the usual black shawl
around their heads, as though it were the dead of
winter, and not a bead of perspiration on them,
with the only cooling place in the town being in
the theatres that are ice-cooled.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"My God&mdash;I'll die from this heat," said Pearl
to herself, as she raised up in bed, with her night-gown
sticking to her. "Jees, I wonder if I'll ever
get used to it," she mused, as she climbed out of
bed and raised the shade, and looked out on the
sun-baked city.</p>

<p>"I wonder what I'll do today to kill the time
before I have to go over to Juarez tonight. I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
know, I'll put on my things and go and wake Ev
up and have breakfast&mdash;then maybe she can suggest
some place to go where it's cool."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Pearl stepped out of her nightgown, looked
at herself in the mirror. She was twenty-three,
but she didn't look more than twenty, her beautiful
white figure, with all the curves of youth
reflected back at her, gave her a happy feeling,
knowing that she didn't look anything like the
rest of the girls that had been down on the border
long, and promising herself that she would watch
out and see that she would never&mdash;never be like
them. The door-knob turned slowly, then the
door was thrown wide open. In walked the big
boy of the night before.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Oh, Heavens," screamed Pearl, "Wait a minute
till I get something on," as she fled into the
bathroom.</p>

<p>"Never mind, sweetheart&mdash;I like you just as
you are, that's why I came up at this hour; I
thought I'd find you in bed, or just getting out
of it."</p>

<p>"Oh, please hand me something to put on,"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
came the voice from the bathroom.</p>

<p>"Hold your hand out to get it, then."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Pearl opened the door to put her hand out,
and as she did, he slid his foot into the opening.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Oh, please, don't come in&mdash;I haven't a thing
on."</p>

<p>"That's why I'm coming in," he answered, as
he pushed the door open and caught her in his
arms.</p>

<p>"Oh, big boy, don't you know you shouldn't
do this? What will you think of me?"</p>

<p>"Baby, I love you&mdash;don't you know that?&mdash;I
love you," he breathed hard, as he kissed her eyes,
her neck, her shoulders, and gathered her up in
his arms and walked toward the bed.</p>

<p>"You will believe me&mdash;won't you&mdash;?" as he
held her as if she were a small baby.</p>

<p>"Oh, big boy, you shouldn't act like this. What
would anyone think if they should see us like
this?"</p>

<p>"What the Hell do I care what anyone thinks&mdash;I
want you and I want you all for myself&mdash;I'll
buy you anything you want. I've got
money<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>&mdash;plenty
of it. Can't you understand that I'll do
anything for you? When you left last night without
even saying goodbye, I looked all over town
for you, but I couldn't find you. You know what
I mean, I don't even know your name, but I want
you to marry me."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Tenderly he laid her down on the bed, smothering
her with kisses.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Pearl looked into his eyes&mdash;he was sober&mdash;sober
as a judge. He was a big man, a very big man,
but he was like a child that had found the toy it
had been looking for for a long time, and was so
happy at finding it that he would never let it go
again. He was fresh, clean, good looking, and had
that very manly odor about him that women love,
and above all, he had money, and lots of it; didn't
Eve say so and didn't he tell her so himself? He
ran his hands over her smooth body, his head was
laying on her shoulder, his big body against hers,
his breath seeming to scorch her. What was the
use to fight against this? She knew that sooner
or later she would give in to his pleadings, the
sooner the better.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
"Yes, dear, I do love you," she whispered, as
she put her arms around him, and pressed her hot
mouth against his hot, moist lips&mdash;they seemed to
melt into one.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Pardon, Madam, do you want to carry all
these bundles, or wouldn't you like for us to send
them over for you?" asked the clerk in the White
House, the largest department store in El Paso.</p>

<p>"Hell, no&mdash;I'll carry them myself," said Evelyn,
as she began to pick up the numerous bundles
she had bought.</p>

<p>"I beg pardon, Madam, but did you want to
charge those things?"</p>

<p>"Jees, my all to Heaven has gone&mdash;certainly I
want to charge them, I got an account here, ain't
I?"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Madam, but we shall soon find
out."</p>

<p>"Yeah&mdash;and for the love of Pete, make it snappy&mdash;don't
keep me in suspense."</p>

<p>"Pardon, Madam," returned the clerk, laying
down the receiver of the store telephone, "I'm
very happy to inform you that your account is
quite all right; thank you very much&mdash;call again."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
"Thank you very much, and I'll call again damn
soon. Adios."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Evelyn returned to her apartment about three-thirty,
unwrapped her packages, smiling to herself,
and fondling her treasures.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Well, I've bought a new outfit from top to
bottom, and from the skin out. Won't I floor
that herd of tramps tonight&mdash;Hot&mdash;ziggety&mdash;damn&mdash;now
I'll bathe, throw on a load of that
loud perfume, and damned if I won't be a lady,
or know why."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"What was that?" asked Pearl, as she sat up
in bed with a start. There was a rapping on the
door.</p>

<p>"Who is it?"</p>

<p>"It's me&mdash;Ev," came the voice outside the door.</p>

<p>"Oh, just a minute, dear, till I unlock the
door."</p>

<p>"My God, don't you ever expect to get up
today? Do you know it is after four o'clock?"
said Evelyn, as she came into the room.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
"Well, I did get up for a little while, but you
see I went back to bed."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see," said Evelyn, as she walked to the
bed on tiptoe, where Big Boy lay sleeping like a
child.</p>

<p>"He came in at noon, and I couldn't get rid
of him, or I would have come over to your place,"
answered Pearl, in a whisper.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad you're able to get up." She
walked over to Big Boy, and pulled the covers
off the bed.</p>

<p>"Hey, what's the big idea?" asked Big Boy as
he raised up in bed.</p>

<p>"Shame on you," said Evelyn, mockingly, "Sitting
up in bed in front of a lady, and you with
no sign of any drawers on. Here, put these on
while I ain't looking," throwing him the trunks
of his two-piece set.</p>

<p>"Oke, Sister; where is Pearl?"</p>

<p>"Don't you hear the water running in the bathroom?
Well, you know darn well I ain't in
there."</p>

<p>"Hey, look, Sister, I'll give you a hundred bucks
if you will talk for me. Look&mdash;I'm nuts about
that girl&mdash;there's nothing I want as much as I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
do her&mdash;here's the hundred&mdash;will you do it?"</p>

<p>"Will I? Boy, my mouth will run from now
on about you. Hell's fire&mdash;I'd talk for a bull with
that much dough."</p>

<p>"You know I want to marry that Broad."</p>

<p>"Well, at least that's cause for the damndest
drunk I can think of&mdash;Hey, Pearl&mdash;get them
things on&mdash;Juarez calleth me in a big way&mdash;and
you too; get them things on. Good Heavens, I'm
dry as a bone. Come to think of it, I ain't had
a drink in nearly an hour."</p>

<p>"My, Ev, you look good today. Where did
you get all those new clothes?" asked Pearl, as
she came out of the bathroom.</p>

<p>"The boy friend I told you about last night.
He is the cause of all this dressing up, and do you
notice the smell? I even put on my best perfume."</p>

<p>"It sure smells good, all right."</p>

<p>"It does now, but wait until I throw a few
beers into me, and I'll be the only one in Juarez
that will smell like a cross between a violet and
a swill barrel," laughed Evelyn.</p>

<p>"Don't you girls think we ought to have
some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>thing
to eat before we start on this drinking
tour?"</p>

<p>"Big Boy, you think of the best things&mdash;food
will do us a lot of good right now. Come to think
of it, I forgot to eat this morning. Damned if I
ain't hungry," answered Evelyn.</p>

<p>"Where shall we go," asked Pearl.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I think that the Hilton Coffee Shoppe
would be grand," suggested Evelyn.</p>

<p>"Hey, look&mdash;Big Boy, you go on down to the
cafe, and order for us, and we will be along in a
few minutes&mdash;will you?"</p>

<p>"Oke, Baby; what do you crave in the way of
food?"</p>

<p>"Well, as for me&mdash;I'll have ham and eggs&mdash;what
do you want, Ev?"</p>

<p>"The same, and lots of it."</p>

<p>"Now, look, you two&mdash;don't be all day," said
Big Boy, as he went out the door, giving Evelyn
a wink.</p>

<p>"Pearl&mdash;" said Evelyn, slowly, "Do you know
what you're letting yourself in for?" as she sat
down on the bed.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;I don't get you, Ev, what do you
mean?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
"Just this, Honey&mdash;I like you&mdash;you're a good
kid, but don't be foolish&mdash;now don't think I'm
trying to tell you your business, but you see I've
been down here for a long time and I know this
border&mdash;Oh, God, how well I know it."</p>

<p>"What are you driving at, Ev?"</p>

<p>"Honey, don't try to kid that guy&mdash;look here,"
said Evelyn, showing Pearl the hundred-dollar bill
Big Boy had given her.</p>

<p>"What's it for, Ev?"</p>

<p>"Well, he's nuts about you&mdash;and he wants to
marry you. Of course, you know that already,
and what's more, it's none of my business, but
for your own good, don't try to string that guy
along. He looks like a kid, that's true. He is as
easy to handle as a kid, but Pearl, he is a killer.
I know him, and I know what he will do. So, if
you want to marry him, and settle down, your
nest will be feathered and in a big way, but don't
try to kid him if you ain't serious&mdash;be frank about
it&mdash;tell him the truth and then lay off him, or
else be all for him. He gave me this money to
talk for him, and to tell you what a great guy he
is, and try to talk you into marrying him&mdash;I ain't
telling you what to do and I ain't telling you what
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
not to do&mdash;but don't kid him, and don't promise
nothing you can't make good."</p>

<p>"Why, Ev, I haven't known you for hardly
twenty-four hours. I didn't even stop to think
you had a serious side&mdash;you are a dear. Sure, I
know what you mean. Now I'll tell you how I
feel towards him. I don't love him, I never could.
He's not my type, but when he gets around me,
and puts his arms around me, and pulls me close,
I can't hold out on him&mdash;he is the personification
of satisfaction&mdash;Oh, Hell, Ev, you know what I
mean, don't you?"</p>

<p>"I admit you ain't left much to my imagination,
but I get you."</p>

<p>"You see, Ev, I am in love&mdash;but I know it is
a hopeless love&mdash;but love, nevertheless&mdash;and it's
Harry Hicks, the guy I went with when I left
you last night in the cafe&mdash;that kid sure got under
my skin."</p>

<p>"Well, he better stay from under them things."</p>

<p>"You don't like Harry, do you, Ev?"</p>

<p>"Well,&mdash;I don't dislike him. I never thought
of him as anything but a big kid and I always
treated him as one&mdash;Harry is a damn good guy
as far as I know, and I don't think that he has
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
an enemy in the world, but don't make the mistake
that lots of the other girls have made with
Harry&mdash;he likes all the girls, and what's more,
he couldn't be true to any one for five minutes,
not even himself&mdash;he's like millions of other men;
to him a woman is for one thing, and when he
is through, he is through&mdash;so the only way to
impress him is to never&mdash;never let him know that
he means any more to you than the lowest Cholo."</p>

<p>"That seems to be the standard formula to make
any man nuts for you."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;good&mdash;Heavens, Pearl, dear, we are forgetting
Big Boy, and most of all to me, we are
forgetting breakfast, even if it is almost dinner
time," said Evelyn, as they hurried to the street.</p>

<p>"Have you been waiting long?" asked Pearl,
as they sat down.</p>

<p>"Not long, but I had begun to be a little impatient."</p>

<p>"Did you order for us yet?" asked Evelyn.</p>

<p>"No, I thought I'd better wait, so I just had
coffee, and decided to read the paper until you
showed up."</p>

<p>"Any news?" asked Pearl.</p>

<p>"Paper says that some old boy down below the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
border is sore because he ain't President, and is
gathering troops back in the mountains to start
a little revolution."</p>

<p>"That ain't nothing new," said Evelyn, "That's
in every day's paper."</p>

<p>"I'll bet it's something awful down here when
a revolution does start," mused Pearl.</p>

<p>"Awful is right&mdash;awfullest laugh in the country,"
answered Evelyn.</p>

<p>"Have you and Big Boy ever been down here
when one started?"</p>

<p>"I'll say," answered Evelyn, as she sipped her
coffee. "I was over in Juarez when the last one
started."</p>

<p>"It must be awful, all those guns."</p>

<p>"Yeah&mdash;the only kind of guns these Mex wars
are fought with is Gonorrhea Guns."</p>

<p>"Listen, honey," said Big Boy, "What are you
doing tomorrow afternoon?"</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;why?" asked Pearl.</p>

<p>"Well, I won't be able to see you tonight, I've
some business to attend to, but tomorrow afternoon
I thought you might like to go swimming
some place."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;I would&mdash;wouldn't you, Ev?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
"I would not. I hate water, even for swimming,
but that don't stop you two from going
and having a good time."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be seeing you, tomorrow afternoon
at two o'clock, at your room, baby," as he picked
up the checks and started for the door.</p>

<p>"Are you sure it's swimming he wants to meet
you for?" asked Evelyn, with a mouth full of
eggs.</p>

<p>"I don't know, Ev&mdash;I can't figure it. I've never
been in love before, and I don't know what it's
like, but I think this is the real thing."</p>

<p>"You mean with Big Boy?" exclaimed Evelyn.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no&mdash;no&mdash;Ev, honey, I mean Harry
Hicks. When that kid took me in his arms last
night out on that mountain, I went hook, line
and sinker, and I don't know how to handle it."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Pearl, yet I'm happy&mdash;but there's
only one thing can come from it, and that's&mdash;trouble&mdash;,
but you got to expect that. You see,
for every bit of fun you have in this racket, you
have twice as much trouble, so my motto is&mdash;laugh,
as long as you can, and take the rest of
it with a grain of salt, so if you love Harry&mdash;you
go right ahead&mdash;let nothing stand in the
way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>&mdash;make
it grand while it lasts&mdash;then when it's over,
you will have something to remember, and nothing
can take that from you."</p>

<p>"Come on, Ev, let's get going. It's early, but
let's go on over to Juarez and have a few snorts,
what do you say?"</p>

<p>"When you mention drinks, you're talking
right up my alley."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Evelyn and Pearl strolled out of the Coffee
Shoppe, and down South El Paso Street, across
in front of the Paso Del Norte Hotel, to wait for
the Juarez car.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"My God, what you all doing standing here,
not saying a word?" came a voice from behind
them.</p>

<p>"Why, hello, Mickey," said Evelyn, as she
turned and saw who it was.</p>

<p>"Hello, Mickey," said Pearl.</p>

<p>"Say, listen, you kids&mdash;got any dates for tonight?"
asked Mickey.</p>

<p>"I ain't," said Evelyn. "Have you, Pearl?"</p>

<p>"I haven't."</p>

<p>"Well, there's three old guys, five days older
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
than Hell, throwing an all-night party in the Rio
Bravo Hotel, and they asked me and Betty to get
as many girls as we could. There's plenty to drink,
plenty to eat&mdash;there will be lots of fellows there
besides them old ones, and there's a chance to
make a few dollars, and if you can't make any
money&mdash;well&mdash;when they get drunk you can
always go through their pockets," said Mickey, in
a voice that was supposed to be confidential, but
still could be heard at least a block away.</p>

<p>"What do you say, Pearl?" asked Evelyn.</p>

<p>"Do you think Harry will be there?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Heavens, be calm," as she lifted her hands
in supplication.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Mickey, "He'll be there; you
couldn't keep him away from them kind of parties.
Last one Harry was on, he got so drunk he stripped
stark naked and did a Spanish down the hall."</p>

<p>"I'll bet that was a sight," said Evelyn.</p>

<p>"Oh, honey, that wasn't no sight at all&mdash;that
big guy here they call Big Boy, well&mdash;he was as
drunk as Harry, and he got naked too, and took
an umbrella and opened it, and used it for a
parachute when he jumped from the second-story
window."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
"Is that the Big Boy we know?" asked Pearl.</p>

<p>"I don't know how well you know him,"
answered Mickey, "but it's the one you was out
in the car with last night."</p>

<p>"Why, jumping out of a second-story window
like that, it's a wonder he didn't break his neck."</p>

<p>"Pearl, dear," said Evelyn, "It wasn't his neck
he lit on."</p>

<p>"How did you know I was out in the car with
Big Boy last night?" Pearl asked Mickey.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;you see, I had been mixing my drinks,
and I was sick, and I went outside to heave. Well,
I was sitting on the running board of the car on
the off side, when you all got in, but I didn't sit
there long."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Evelyn.</p>

<p>"Honey, riding a wild horse is tame beside trying
to sit on that fender," laughed Mickey. "Well,
I'll see you all tonight at the party, as soon as the
bridge closes." She waved as she went on down
the street.</p>

<p>"Don't you get sore at nothing anybody says
to you&mdash;she is a good scout, Pearl, and when you
know her better you will like her, I'm sure."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;Ev, why would I get sore&mdash;come, come,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
come&mdash;here is our car." Pearl grabbed Evelyn's
hand and started running for the car.</p>

<p>"My Heavens," exclaimed Evelyn, "This street
car reminds me of some Madam's parlor&mdash;there's
five girls I know&mdash;hello, gang."</p>

<p>"O.&nbsp;K., Ev. How is the biggest liquor and beer
consumer today?" asked one of the girls.</p>

<p>"I'm fine. Girls, this is Pearl. She is a newcomer
in our midst, and a good scout&mdash;Pearl, this
is the girls&mdash;find out their names for yourself. I
knew what some of their names was last week,
but only Heaven knows what they are this week."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The girls smiled and said hello to Pearl, and all
moved over for them to sit down.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Ev, what's this I hear about a party tonight
at the Rio Bravo Hotel&mdash;have you heard about
it yet?"</p>

<p>"Yeah&mdash;Mickey Finn, you know her, we just
run into her at the corner, and she told us about
it, and said for us to come. Are you going?"</p>

<p>"Sure, we all are."</p>

<p>"Do you think it will be all right, Ev?" asked
Pearl, under her breath.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
"I don't get you&mdash;how do you mean all right?"</p>

<p>"Well, I've never been on an all-night party in
Juarez&mdash;so naturally I'm curious&mdash;but what I
mean is&mdash;can you get away with much over here
without the Mexicans landing you in jail?"</p>

<p>"As long as there ain't no murder, or absolute
destruction of property&mdash;you are pretty safe, but
why bother&mdash;wait till you get in the can before
you start worrying about it."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Juarez, with its lights twinkling in the glowing
dusk&mdash;with its midnight purple mountains looking
like big, futuristic pillows flanking it on three
sides, the skies screaming, flaming, gold, crimson,
varied colors of reds, shading into blue, darker
blue, then deep blue, then to purple in the far east,
with the sounds of laughing, running, playing
dogs and children, sounds of a twanging guitar
slightly out of tune, accompanied by a nasal but
sincere Mexican love song being sung to a Senorita
with dark eyes and broken, dirty teeth, and
bosoms that would make a Holstein cow's eyes
bulge with envy&mdash;smells of all sorts drifted on the
soft, gentle breeze, of tortillas, of beans frying
with cheese, of chili sauces, of charcoal, of
un<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>washed
dirty bodies, of manure, both human and
animal. A street car rattling by with its cargo of
brilliantly painted cheeks, flashing smiles, syphilis-carrying,
would-be, has-been, and are-to-be whores.</p>

<p>Signs advertising whiskeys, and liquors of all
kinds, brilliant in color, flashed in the deepening
dusk, their utter defiance at the American side of
the border. The extra bartenders were coming on
duty, extra waiters were appearing in respective
places, rubbing their hands together like pawnbrokers,
at the thought of the night's tips; at the
thought of what could be taken out of the pockets
of one too drunk to notice; at the thought of the
tips that would be thrown at the entertainers that
would roll where they could stoop and pick it up
without being noticed; at the thought of drunken
women's pocketbooks that can so easily be gone
into in a crowded place without fear of being
caught. This was Saturday night, the biggest
night of the week.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"We are getting off here at the corner," said
one of the five girls. "We are going to start with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
the Gold Palace, Pearl; you and Ev come along
with us."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Evelyn started to rise.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Thanks," said Pearl, as she caught Evelyn's
arm, "We are going to ride around to the Lobby
No. 2. I've a friend around there to see on business&mdash;but
we will see you at the party, if not
sooner. I hope you all have some good luck
tonight."</p>

<p>"Thanks, honey," called one of the girls, "I'm
damned if we don't need it."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you come on and get off and get
a drink? I don't think Harry is there yet&mdash;it's a
little early for him."</p>

<p>"Oh, Ev, I just can't wait."</p>

<p>"Well, I admit you sure got it bad."</p>

<p>"Say, how do these parties usually end, and
where?"</p>

<p>"They usually end in the Goddamnest fight,
and just anywhere that they didn't start," answered
Evelyn.</p>

<p>"Do you think this one will end that way?"</p>

<p>"I can't see why this one should be any
differ<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>ent
from any of the rest; besides, Mickey Finn is
going to be there, and that's always the sign of a
fight."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Hugo's Lobby No. 2 was brilliantly lighted, as
ever, and much less crowded than the night before,
owing to the early hour. As Pearl and Evelyn
walked in, there were about fifteen or twenty
people at the bar, and about three times as many
in the cabaret having dinner.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Hello, Henry," called Evelyn, "Two whiskeys
for two ladies."</p>

<p>"Coming up, Ev."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Pearl felt two cool hands slip over her eyes,
and a soft voice in her ear, that made her body
quiver and caused a tight feeling in her stomach.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Guess who, darling," said the voice in her ear.</p>

<p>"Hi&mdash;Harry, you big louse," came from Evelyn
before Pearl could say a word.</p>

<p>"Oh, gee, Ev, you spoiled my game," said
Harry poutingly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
"She ain't no game, Harry&mdash;she's a sure thing,"
winked Evelyn.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Harry took Pearl in his arms, gave her a big
hug, and then kissed her.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Oh, Harry&mdash;what will people think?"</p>

<p>"Look all around you," said Evelyn, "Not a
soul has noticed you."</p>

<p>"What are you having to drink, Harry?" asked
the bartender.</p>

<p>"Whiskey, pal," answered Harry; then to
Pearl, "Listen, honey, are you doing anything tonight?
I'm going on a party, and it may be a bit
rough, but would you like to come? I know you
will have a good time."</p>

<p>"I know all about the party, darling, and Ev
and I are both going, aren't we, Ev?"</p>

<p>"Sure thing."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's great," said Harry. "Well, I got
to be going now. I've got to get that band to
playing, and start a little excitement in there, or
the guests will kick. So long, honey, I'll see you
at the party."</p>

<p>"Oh, Henry, another whiskey for me," called
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
Evelyn. "What do you want, dear&mdash;whiskey or
smelling salts?"</p>

<p>"Both," answered Pearl.</p>

<p>"Do you really like him as much as that? No
kidding, come clean."</p>

<p>"Honestly, cross my heart, I love him&mdash;like
Hell."</p>

<p>"Well, suppose you catch another dame cooing
over him, and making love to him in a big way&mdash;then
what?"</p>

<p>"I'd cut enough meat off her rear end to feed
the dogs for a week," said Pearl, viciously.</p>

<p>"Well, I admit there are a lot of rear ends in
this town that could stand a little cut off here
and there, but some of them are so tough you
would have to use a hack-saw to do it," tittered
Evelyn. "Did you ever stop to think that Big
Boy might feel the same way about you that you
feel about Harry? Have you stopped to think of
that, and have you stopped to think Harry might
feel about you the way you feel about Big Boy?
Now, honey, don't think I'm butting in, cause I
ain't, but think about it, will you?"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Rio Bravo Hotel, on the Sixteenth of
Sep<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>tember
Street, is the Class A hotel of the town.
With the street cars running in front of it, with
the railroad track on the side of it, a rip-snorting
bar under it, and the numerous parties going on
inside of it, it would hardly be a place one would
pick out to spend a quiet evening, or get a night's
sleep&mdash;so when one goes to the Rio Bravo, one
does not go for anything less than a party&mdash;or
maybe to earn two dollars, but, of course, that
takes but a matter of a few minutes&mdash;in Juarez,
but as so many of the local population figure, why
spend a dollar for a room when there are so many
dark nooks and corners off the main street, and
parked cars, whether your own or someone else's.</p>

<p>The rooms in this establishment are furnished
with only the bare necessities of a room&mdash;a bed,
a chair, sometimes a rocker, sometimes with the
rockers broken off, but still used as a chair, a rug
on the floor, but never a big one, or a good one,
and the bathroom, but never in the history of
Juarez has the hotel water heater ever been known
to work, never any toilet paper, but a pile of newspapers
stacked in the corner, a mirror, a cracked
one, but still usable, if you are not particular&mdash;and
one seldom is&mdash;when one is on a party.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
It was twelve-thirty, the mad rush for the International
bridge was over, the gates separating the
two republics were closed until six o'clock in the
morning.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Think we better stop and have some coffee
before we go on up to the hotel, what do you
think?" said Evelyn, as she and Pearl walked arm
in arm unsteadily up the street.</p>

<p>"If we gotta do a lot of drinking up there, it
wouldn't be a bad idea," answered Pearl. "Here's
as good a place as any." She took Evelyn's arm
and turned her into a little Mexican cafe.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>They sat and sipped their coffee for a while,
said nothing to each other, or to anyone else, as
they were the only ones in the place except the
little weezened black waiter, who could easily
have been mistaken for a Negro, had it not been
for his straight black hair.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"All through?" asked Evelyn.</p>

<p>"Yeah&mdash;let's get going and see what this joint
of joy is going to be like."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
They left the place, and walked up the street
toward the Rio Bravo. As they were crossing the
railroad tracks next to the hotel, Evelyn stopped,
"Good Lord, look coming&mdash;there's Ruby, Myrtle,
Betty, Billie, Lillian, Virginia, Annie, Laura,
Irene, Marie, and I don't know any of the others."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Well, we must not be late for the party, anyhow,
seeing that they are just arriving."</p>

<p>"Jees&mdash;there's probably twice that many already
up there," answered Evelyn.</p>

<p>"Where do they all come from?"</p>

<p>"A party in this town does the same thing to
these Hookers that cheese does to rats."</p>

<p>"Let's wait a minute and let them go on in,"
said Pearl.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>They waited until the girls had disappeared:
"Come on, dearie, we might as well go on and
crash it and see what's going on." They went up
the steps and into the lobby, which was rather
bare, with nothing but a few leather chairs, showing
considerable use, and a desk at the back near
the stairs.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
"Oh, Senorita Evelyn, I have not see you for
so long time, I have near forget what you look
like," bowed the clerk, who was possessed of a
monstrous stomach.</p>

<p>"Hi&mdash;Guts&mdash;we are looking for that party
that's going on here tonight."</p>

<p>"A thousand pardons, Senorita, there is five
parties going tonight. You will look and see which
one you are invited to. I need not go up with
you&mdash;you will hear these parties long before you
see them. Have a very good time, Senorita."</p>

<p>"Come back here, you slut&mdash;do you hear me&mdash;come
back here with my leg," came a voice, as
Evelyn and Pearl neared the second floor.</p>

<p>"You can just go to Hell, you cheap, lousy
bastard, having the nerve to promise me two dollars,
and then when I'm ready to go, you saying
you wasn't going to give me a dime&mdash;Goddam
you, you just try and get this leg back," said
Mickey Finn, as she came to the head of the stairs,
with an artificial leg under her arm, with the shoe
and sock still on it.</p>

<p>"What's the trouble, Mickey?" asked Evelyn,
as she and Pearl came up.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
"Why, can you believe a guy would have the
nerve to pull a trick like that on me&mdash;promising
me my money, and then not giving it to me? I'm
taking this leg and hock it&mdash;to Hell with him&mdash;the
thing that makes me sore is anyone trying to
pull a lousy trick like that on me&mdash;can you believe
it?" fumed Mickey.</p>

<p>"Come back here with my leg, you bitch. If I
get my hands on you, I'll wring your damn neck."</p>

<p>"Go to Hell," screamed Mickey, "You'll pay me
more than two dollars to get this leg back."</p>

<p>"Pipe down, Mickey," shushed Evelyn, "If
Guts hears you, he'll raise Hell right."</p>

<p>"A thousand pardons, Senoritas, but what is
this trouble&mdash;and you&mdash;what are you doing with
the Senor's leg?" came the voice of Guts from
behind the trio.</p>

<p>"You seen me come in here with this guy,
didn't you, Guts? He paid for the room, didn't
he? Well, after he had his fun he refused to pay
me my two dollars, and I'm damned if I ain't
taking his false leg for the bill&mdash;and come to think
of it, what have you got to say about it? Are
you for me, or are you against me? You remember,
I know of a couple of dirty deals I could tell
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
the Custom and Federal authorities about&mdash;and
by God, you know me, Guts," frothed Mickey.</p>

<p>"Ah, Senorita&mdash;I am so sorry. Why you did
not call me before? You are my friend, and no
one can say different," answered Guts, as he
pulled his enormous belly up, and with a scowl
on his near-black face, started down the hall toward
the half-opened door.</p>

<p>"Take that leg away from that slut," ordered
the man, leaning against the dresser to support
himself, as Guts and the three girls came into the
room.</p>

<p>"Why have you refuse to pay the Senorita?"
asked Guts.</p>

<p>"Refuse to pay her&mdash;why, the damn liar&mdash;I
have paid her."</p>

<p>"You are just lying because there's some other
people here. You ain't give me a red cent, and
what's more, you are giving me ten dollars or I'm
taking the leg. Ain't I right, Guts?"</p>

<p>"Si, Senorita, you are right."</p>

<p>"Hand the leg over and I'll give you the ten
dollars to get rid of you."</p>

<p>"All right, I'll give it to you, but don't you
try to pull nothing funny or I'll take that thing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
away from you again, and beat the Hell out of
you with it," said Mickey, as she handed him
the leg.</p>

<p>"Thanks," said the man, as he took the leg,
and reached down the top of it and pulled out a
roll of bills, "Here's your ten," as he dug it out
of a roll of fifties and hundreds.</p>

<p>"I'll be damned!" said Mickey, as they all left
the room, "That's what I get for getting chicken-hearted,
and giving it back to him. Every time I
get sympathetic I lose money."</p>

<p>"Cheer up, Mickey&mdash;let's find the drinks," said
Evelyn.</p>

<p>"Well, you ain't got far to look. They are
right above us on the next floor," answered
Mickey, as she made for the stairs.</p>

<p>"Well, nobody can't say it ain't starting off
well&mdash;if we all don't end in the Mex jail, it will
be a miracle of fate."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As they reached the third floor a sight greeted
their eyes that would have made the old Roman
gatherings look like child's play. There were
couples everywhere in the hall, some fully dressed,
some partially dressed, others practically nude, all
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
oblivious of each other, while in the room there
were less clothes but many more bodies, laying
around on the floor, sprawled on chairs, on the
bed, on the bathroom floor, while the bathtub was
piled high with ice and bottles of every description;
the connecting room to the bathroom had
been opened, and an old phonograph was scratching
the Mexican National Anthem, while a couple
scantily clad, both male and female, in ladies'
step-ins, insisted on doing their idea of the rhumba,
which consisted mostly of the male part of the
team goosing the female with the third finger of
the hand, while she leaped, and screamed, with
elephantine grace, much to the joy of the spectators,
who were beginning to undress and join
the dance, midst shouts and screams of gaiety.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Of the three hosts that gave the party, two had
passed to the realm of unconsciousness, while the
third sat stark nude on the dresser, with his
toupee in one hand, and a bottle of whiskey in the
other, wasting no time in trying to join his friends
in the happy state of unconsciousness.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Looks like good pickings to me," said Mickey.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
"Everybody is undressed&mdash;it won't be no trouble
to go through their pockets."</p>

<p>"Good God, the bathroom is the place we are
looking for. That is where all the drinks are.
Come, come, my dear, let us not waste time,"
said Evelyn, as she stepped over the sprawled
bodies on the floor.</p>

<p>"Jees, this takes the prize&mdash;I been on lots of
parties, but never on one like this," said Pearl,
as she followed Evelyn, who by this time was
opening a fresh, cold bottle of whiskey.</p>

<p>"Why, the Hell&mdash;will they put whiskey on
ice."</p>

<p>"Well, you couldn't expect anybody in this
condition to know any different, could you, Ev?"</p>

<p>"You couldn't expect people who get in this
condition to give a damn in the first place," said
Evelyn, as she took a long swig of the freshly
opened bottle, "Even I don't care after the first
ten drinks."</p>

<p>"Quick&mdash;give me a slug of that stuff&mdash;if I ever
get sober on a thing like this, and actually realize
what it's all about, I'd do a nose dive out of my
hotel window some morning," said Pearl, as Evelyn
handed her the bottle. "Come to think of
it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>&mdash;I
ain't seen hide nor hair of Harry, and he said
he would be here."</p>

<p>"Well, Pearl, dear, when you see a pile of
whores about ten deep, dig to the bottom of them
and you will find Harry&mdash;at least, that's where
he usually is."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;Jees&mdash;that's lousy whiskey&mdash;open another
bottle&mdash;that tastes like tobacco juice."</p>

<p>"There's going to be trouble here this night as
sure as the world stands&mdash;" said Evelyn under her
breath. "I just saw Juan Moros pass the door&mdash;and
that's a bad sign, as sure as you're born."</p>

<p>"Who is Juan Moros?"</p>

<p>"He's the boy friend of Negro Noche, and he
has been on the trail of Irene, the blonde girl that
came in with the crowd we saw come in just ahead
of us. You know Irene, the tall blonde&mdash;he is
crazy about her."</p>

<p>"Well, what's that got to do with us?" asked
Pearl.</p>

<p>"Plenty&mdash;and in more ways than one&mdash;Negro
Noche is the one woman in the town to be afraid
of. She has been pulled in by the government
officials several times for smuggling dope over the
border into the United States&mdash;but they have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
never been able to convict her. She was arrested
not long ago for smuggling Chinese across, and
several attempts have been made to frame her, but
no one has ever been able to pin it on her, and
now she has threatened to kill any woman that she
catches the boy friend with, and what's more,
Irene is crazy about him. Now, ain't that cause
for trouble?"</p>

<p>"Well, I can't see what that has got to do with
this party. He is here and so is Irene, but that is
no cause for trouble&mdash;surely she wouldn't come
up here and start trouble," reasoned Pearl.</p>

<p>"Which proves conclusively that you don't know
Negro Noche."</p>

<p>"You might add that I don't want to."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;well, hello, Henry, you devil&mdash;I
thought you went home to your wife every night,"
said Evelyn, as a bartender she knew came into
the bathroom.</p>

<p>"Well," laughed Henry, "She can't say nothing
if I don't get through work in time, and get
locked on this side of the river, can she?"</p>

<p>"Not unless you pull that gag once too often&mdash;here,
have a drink," as she offered him the bottle.</p>

<p>"Well, Pearl, what do you think of the party?"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
asked Henry, as he turned to Pearl, who was looking
out into the other room, trying to see Harry.</p>

<p>"Henry, my darling, since you inquire, I think it
is the most charming affair&mdash;in fact, I've never
been on a party where so little self-consciousness
was present&mdash;in plain English, it is the damndest
thing I've ever seen&mdash;let's drink to it," as she
raised her bottle and clinked it against his.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The phonograph in the adjoining room had
stopped, but everyone was singing instead. Everybody
had joined the first couple in the rhumba,
making the scene more hilarious by not having
any clothes on at all.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Hi, baby," said Harry, as he staggered into
the bathroom.</p>

<p>"Oh, Harry, I'm glad you came. I was afraid
you might change your mind," said Pearl, happily.</p>

<p>"Where you are concerned, baby, I never
change my mind&mdash;let's have a drink."</p>

<p>"Come on, Henry," said Evelyn, "Let's leave
these two in here. It's plain to be seen they don't
need us."</p>

<p>"Ev, you're a damn good mind-reader," said
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
Harry. "Here, take a couple more bottles with
you, so you won't have to bother us."</p>

<p>"Thanks, I'll just do that little thing," as she
took two extra bottles.</p>

<p>"Ah, baby&mdash;I want you so," said Harry, as he
pulled Pearl to him and smothered her with kisses.
"Come on, let's undress and go in the next room
and join the dance."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Harry, I've never done anything like
that."</p>

<p>"Oh, baby&mdash;baby&mdash;don't you trust me? Have
another drink."</p>

<p>"Yes, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No buts," said Harry, as he began to unfasten
her dress. "Come on, I'll help you undress
and then you have to help me."</p>

<p>"Harry&mdash;please&mdash;I don't really want to undress."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
"You see&mdash;you see&mdash;you don't love me, that
proves it."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes I do, Harry&mdash;I like you so much, but
I can't see where my undressing could have anything
to do with it."</p>

<p>"That just proves it&mdash;proves it right there&mdash;you
don't care a thing about me."</p>

<p>"Harry, if you were sober you wouldn't do a
thing like this. I'm not sober by any means myself,
but I don't want to undress."</p>

<p>"You see&mdash;you just want to spoil my whole
night."</p>

<p>"Oh, all right&mdash;if my stripping will make you
happy, I might as well strip&mdash;give me that bottle.
I'll have to get a little drunker to enjoy this&mdash;here
goes," as she put the bottle to her mouth,
taking long, big swallows.</p>

<p>"Atta girl&mdash;I knew you would be a good
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
scout," as he tried to help her get her dress off
over her head.</p>

<p>Pearl took off her dress, laid it over a chair,
took off her step-ins, laid them with her dress,
keeping only her shoes and stockings on.</p>

<p>"Oh, gee, baby&mdash;you sure look good to me&mdash;I'm
just crazy about you."</p>

<p>"All right&mdash;you keep your word&mdash;you undress,
too."</p>

<p>"Sure, I'll undress," said Harry, as he started
to take off his pants, shirt, and underwear, and
laid them on the chair with Pearl's things, standing
before her in only his shoes and socks.</p>

<p>"Let's have a couple more drinks, Harry, darling&mdash;you
know, I believe I'm going to enjoy this
after all."</p>

<p>"I know I am," as he put his huge arms around
her cool, pink body.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;so help me&mdash;what the Hell is coming
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
off here?" said Evelyn, as she came into the bathroom,
her face blank in wonderment.</p>

<p>"Oh, Jees&mdash;this is great&mdash;let's have a drink,"
said Henry, as he came in behind Evelyn. "You
know, Ev, we might as well join the merry, mad
gang&mdash;what do you say?"</p>

<p>"I dare you, Henry," answered Evelyn, as she
started to strip with speed.</p>

<p>Pearl, in Harry's arms, leaped into the milling,
singing, drinking, wrestling mob, in the semi-dark
room, held tight in each others' arms, naked
bodies rubbed against each other, strangers kissed
passionately, lovers kissed more passionately, enemies
kissed less passionately, but kissed&mdash;in their
drunken orgy they had forgotten what they were
enemies about&mdash;couples who had been dancing
longer than the others fell on the floor, locked in
each others' arms, their legs stuck grotesquely in
the air above them, while their burning wet lips
were pressed tightly against each others' mouths,
stopping only long enough to take a drink.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
A shriek from the bathroom&mdash;Evelyn and
Henry leaped into the mob, naked as the rest&mdash;"Shake
it up, baby," screamed Evelyn, as she and
Henry in a tight embrace started singing and dancing
with the rest; as the other couples fell to the
floor newer and fresher couples joined the throng&mdash;only
to fall later on the floor, to continue the
party with mad, wet kisses, and&mdash;?</p>

<p>"My snow-white darling, I have love you so
veer long, I weel never love but you&mdash;I have
never love no one but you&mdash;only you&mdash;my darling&mdash;my
darling&mdash;" came a soft voice near Pearl's
ear, and as she looked closely, she saw it was the
tall, handsome Moros, with the blonde Irene in
his arms.</p>

<p>"Get your Goddam foot out of my face," yelled
a drunken voice.</p>

<p>"My humble pardon, Senor&mdash;I am looking for
some one," answered the deep, sober voice of a
Mexican woman.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
"Why the Hell don't you turn on the light, then?"</p>

<p>"That, Senor, is a veer good idea," as she returned
to the door and snapped on a flood of
bright, red light.</p>

<p>Couples that were still on their feet, stopped
dead still. Couples that were on the floor, stopped
whatever they were doing&mdash;all looking towards
the door, where the Mexican woman was standing,
her hand still on the light button. Not a
soul moved.</p>

<p>Negro Noche stood motionless&mdash;her pock-marked
face covered with a heavy layer of snow
white powder that is typical of all Mexican
women. Eyes gleaming, breathing heavily, she
pulled a heavy, dark-blue, 45-calibre automatic
from under her dirty coat, as a grim smile broke
the death-like mask that was her face. Six shots
rent the dead silence. Juan and Irene lay in each
others' arms, just as they had a few minutes before,
but they knew it not. Negro Noche had
accomplished her purpose&mdash;her lover and her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
rival were to annoy her no more&mdash;the gun silent
in her hand, finger still on the light button, a
blue wisp of smoke rose from the end of the gun,
as the blood from the two bodies rapidly spread
on the cheap, worn carpet&mdash;pandemonium broke
loose.</p>

<p>Pearl ran into the bathroom to get her clothes&mdash;Evelyn
was already there&mdash;"My God, what
will we do?" asked Pearl.</p>

<p>"This ain't no time to sing Frankie and
Johnnie&mdash;don't wait to put your clothes on&mdash;run
for it," answered Evelyn, as she grabbed Pearl
and started for the hall.</p>

<p>Women were screaming, crying&mdash;men were
yelling and cursing, running up and down the
hall, some too excited to realize that they had on
no clothes&mdash;others just running around in circles.</p>

<p>As Evelyn and Pearl came to the stairs, Guts
was on his way up. He started to ask Evelyn and
Pearl what had happened, but they brushed by
and on down the stairs. As they rounded the
sec<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>ond
floor, they saw Mickey Finn on her hands
and knees looking through a key-hole.</p>

<p>"My God, Mickey," said Evelyn, excitedly,
"Don't waste no time&mdash;get out of here quick."</p>

<p>"What's happened&mdash;what was all them shots?"
as she rose off her knees and came to them.</p>

<p>"Negro Noche&mdash;shot Juan and Irene&mdash;don't
waste a minute&mdash;we have got to get on the U.&nbsp;S.
side somehow."</p>

<p>They all three ran down the stairs into the
lobby, and out the front door, onto the street.</p>

<p>"Down the railroad tracks towards the bridge."</p>

<p>"We can't cross that bridge," said Mickey.</p>

<p>"I know it," answered Evelyn, "but it's dark
down that way, and we can put our clothes on&mdash;come
on," as they ran down the tracks.</p>

<p>They stopped in the deep darkness and put
their clothes on.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
"Now, listen to me," said Evelyn, "I have a
plan. We will get back over on Lysol Lane, and
go in one of those all-night bars, and I'll telephone
to Tony, a taxi driver I know, where to meet us."</p>

<p>"Do you think it will work?" asked Pearl.</p>

<p>"It's got to," said Mickey, as they started.</p>

<p>"Now, you two stand around the corner&mdash;I'll
stagger in this dump, as though nothing had happened,
and use the phone."</p>

<p>"Can't I go with you?"</p>

<p>"No, you stay with Mickey&mdash;if they see all
three of us they will be sure to suspect something,
and I don't crave to get mixed up in this mess&mdash;stand
back there in the dark," as she put on her
best drunken smile and staggered into the place.</p>

<p>"Hi, Senor&mdash;can a lady use your phone?"</p>

<p>"Si, Senorita&mdash;right this way," he led her over
to the phone booth in the corner.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
"Gracia, Senor," as she went in and closed the
door, lifted the receiver&mdash;"El Paso operator,
please&mdash;Hello&mdash;El Paso operator&mdash;give me Main
Eight-Eight&mdash;Yeah&mdash;Hello, all-night taxi? Let me
talk to Tony. What&mdash;Oh, that's you, Tony?
Listen, get a load of this&mdash;this is Ev, you know&mdash;yeah&mdash;take
one of the plain cars you got there,
and cruise along the Smelter Road near the Southern
Pacific bridge, and look out for three of us.
No&mdash;no&mdash;no&mdash;it's not liquor&mdash;don't ask questions
over the phone&mdash;make it snappy&mdash;good-bye."
She hung up the receiver, and staggered
out of the booth. "Adios, Senor," as she went
out the door and around the corner, to Mickey
and Pearl.</p>

<p>"I just heard the ambulance and the police
wagon going up the street," said Mickey.</p>

<p>"Tony is going to meet us up on the Smelter
Road," said Evelyn. "We'll go down these side
streets until we get to the river, and then we'll
follow the levee on around to where it is only
about twenty feet wide, and about three feet deep.
I know the very place. We won't have any
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
trouble if we hurry&mdash;come on." So saying, they
started for the river, down dark alleys and side
streets, of which there are plenty in Juarez.</p>

<p>They stumbled on through the darkness, half
running, sometimes walking. "I'm sure I hear
someone following us," said Pearl, as they neared
the river.</p>

<p>"Your life ain't worth two cents over here in
this section at this hour of the night," answered
Evelyn.</p>

<p>"Let's run," said Mickey, as they started on
down the levee.</p>

<p>"How far is this place you know about, Ev?"
asked Pearl, out of breath, as they slowed to a
fast walk again.</p>

<p>"About a mile or more," answered Evelyn,
"But it's our only chance."</p>

<p>It seemed like ten miles to the three, as they
ran stumbling through the darkness, when a flare
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
lit up the sky ahead of them to the right.</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked Pearl.</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven, it's the smelter," said Mickey.
"We are almost there."</p>

<p>"Here's the place I mean," said Evelyn, as she
pointed to a very narrow place in the river. "Now,
let's all take hands, and hold tight. The only
thing we have to be careful of is the quicksands&mdash;they
are as treacherous as Hell," as they started
to wade into the river.</p>

<p>"Watch your step," said Evelyn.</p>

<p>"Jees&mdash;that water is cold&mdash;hold tight to my
hand, Pearl, and don't let go," said Mickey, as
she took hold of Pearl, who was in the middle.</p>

<p>"We are in the midst of a lot of quicksand
here&mdash;I can't seem to find bottom any further
than I am standing. Let go of me, Pearl, and I'll
wade around a bit and see if I can find a more
solid place."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
"Oh, God&mdash;now, Ev, don't do that. Don't let
go at all here in the water&mdash;we will all wade
together."</p>

<p>"Hold tight, then, and we will wade up the
side here a ways, and maybe we will find more
solid bottom," as they started up the side of the
stream.</p>

<p>Slowly they waded in until they were in about
five feet of the bank.</p>

<p>"I think we are going to make it all right,"
said Evelyn, as she was almost jerked off her feet
by Pearl falling to her knees in the water, and
Mickey went out of sight.</p>

<p>"Hold on to me," gasped Pearl, "I've still got
hold of her&mdash;she is in a sand-hole," as she rose
to her feet, pulling Mickey's head above water,
helping her to get solid footing again.</p>

<p>Evelyn reached back and took hold of Mickey's
free hand, and slowly they reached the bank and
climbed out on solid ground again.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
"Are you all right, Mickey?" came from Evelyn
and Pearl at the same time.</p>

<p>"Yeah&mdash;I'm O.&nbsp;K., but I'd been a goner if
Pearl hadn't had a good hold on me. That hole
I fell in back there didn't have no bottom, at least,
I didn't feel any&mdash;My God, what a night," as
she stooped over and felt of her stockings to see
if her money was still there. "Yeah, I still got
my money, but I'll have to dry it, but wet money
is better than no money."</p>

<p>"Listen&mdash;what is that I hear? It sounds&mdash;there
it is&mdash;somebody trying to catch another car&mdash;it's
the police siren and it's coming this way as
sure as you're born," said Evelyn, "I'll go up near
the road and see if I see anything of Tony. You
watch me and when you see me motion to you,
come a-running, because if we are caught at this,
it will be just too bad," as she started toward the
road.</p>

<p>"Stoop down," said Mickey, "We will keep
low to the ground and go as close to the road as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
we can, so we won't have far to run when Ev
motions."</p>

<p>Bright lights came into sight, of a speeding car
coming from town, as Evelyn came up on the
edge of the road, and as the car came near her,
its brakes began to scream, as lights following it
came into view, with the shrieking of the police
siren.</p>

<p>"Quick, get in," said the voice of a man, as
the car came to a stop. "The cops are wise."</p>

<p>"Oh, Jees, where are Pearl and Mickey?" as
she jerked the door of the car open.</p>

<p>"Here," as they came alongside of Evelyn.</p>

<p>Tony shifted the gears of the car, and was
moving, as the three pulled and helped each other
in, the other car nearing, with the siren screaming
louder and louder. Tony shot into the night. "Lay
down on the floor, girls, and get ready for the
ride of your life. If I can beat the cops to the
fork of the Mesa road, we have a chance&mdash;if not&mdash;we
are jail-house bound for some time to come."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
"What the Hell are we passing that's throwing
all that light," asked Pearl.</p>

<p>"It's some cement company," answered Evelyn,
as they went into darkness again.</p>

<p>"Hey, Tony, how do you think they found out
about this?" asked Mickey.</p>

<p>"One of them lousy telephone operators tipped
them off, that is the only way they could have
found out&mdash;the dirty fluzey."</p>

<p>"Good God&mdash;I hope we get away from them
all right," murmured Pearl, as the car lurched and
shot through the deepening dark.</p>

<p>"Are we leaving them behind yet, Tony?"</p>

<p>"Not yet we ain't, not till we get off these
curves, but when we get on that straight stretch
of road, I'll leave 'em plenty far behind."</p>

<p>"Hey, Tony," said Evelyn, as she got up on her
knees, with her hands on the back of the front
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
seat, "You don't think they could have sent a car
out on the Mesa road, maybe to head us off, do
you?"</p>

<p>"Well, that's a chance we got to take, but I
don't think they would have had time even if
they had thought, which they probably didn't&mdash;but
I'll tell you something&mdash;we gotta leave that
bunch quick when we hit that straight piece of
road, if we don't they will try to shoot the rear
tires off. You girls stay on the floor, in case they
do shoot."</p>

<p>"O.&nbsp;K., Tony," said Evelyn, as she got back
down on the floor.</p>

<p>"Get ready, girls, we are coming to that straight
part," as the car fairly felt like it was leaving the
earth.</p>

<p>"We must be doing seventy or more&mdash;at least,
if anything does happen while we are going this
fast, we won't have to worry about it, anyhow,"
said Mickey, as she lay jouncing in her wet,
sloppy dress, covered with sand and mud.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
"I hope you don't take cold, Mickey. You know
you got your head wet. I was lucky, that's the
only thing I didn't get wet," from Pearl.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;" said Evelyn, "If them guys start
shooting at us, there'll be more water in the car,
and it won't have come from the river."</p>

<p>"I wonder what became of Harry?"</p>

<p>"I'll bet he ain't worrying about you," said
Evelyn.</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;at least, I hope he won't get
in jail."</p>

<p>"Jail, Hell," said Mickey, "He came down them
steps ahead of you two, and I mean way ahead
of you. Them shots hadn't no more than stopped
when Harry come down so fast it would take
two people to see him, one to see him coming and
one to see him going."</p>

<p>"What was that hit the car?" asked Evelyn,
as she raised up.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
"Just a bullet bouncing off&mdash;but they will have
to shoot fast now, I'm doing eighty&mdash;and what's
more, I'm leaving them behind. We will be fairly
safe in a minute or so, unless as you said, Ev&mdash;about
the other car on the Mesa road, and I don't
think we will have any trouble from that."</p>

<p>"Damn, I hope not&mdash;I'd hate to have to sit in
jail with these wet clothes on," said Mickey.</p>

<p>"I don't care much about setting in jail wet or
dry."</p>

<p>"You two don't have to worry&mdash;Tony is a good
driver, and we got a good chance of getting away,"
reasoned Evelyn.</p>

<p>"Well, suppose they start looking for us, to
question us?" asked Pearl.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;" said Evelyn, "Here's our story&mdash;this
goes for you too, Tony&mdash;Pearl, you stayed with
me tonight in my apartment&mdash;and you, Tony, you
stayed with Mickey, and remember, we all went
to bed about twelve-thirty, and don't let them jar
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
you loose from that story, so if we all tell the same
story, and stick to it, what can they do?"</p>

<p>"Look what a break you're getting, Tony,"
laughed Mickey, "You stayed with me tonight."</p>

<p>"I suppose you are going to tell me now that I
owe you two dollars," laughed Tony, "But say&mdash;what
the Hell happened over there&mdash;a fight?"</p>

<p>"Hell, no, I wish it had been only a fight&mdash;but
it wasn't&mdash;Negro Noche shot her boy friend and
Irene."</p>

<p>"Jees, Ev, are they both dead?"</p>

<p>"Yeah&mdash;they never knew what hit them."</p>

<p>"No wonder you were so anxious to get back
on this side tonight."</p>

<p>"How soon before we reach that Mesa fork,
Tony?" asked Mickey.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
"In just a few minutes now&mdash;look back and see
how close those lights are."</p>

<p>"Oh, Hell," answered Evelyn, as she looked out
the back of the car. "They are damn near out of
sight, Tony."</p>

<p>"Good&mdash;we'll make it all right now&mdash;hold tight
back there&mdash;I'm making the turn&mdash;we are nearing
the fork." The screaming of rubber on the
concrete, as the big car turned the corner on two
wheels. "Now, you girls can get on the seat and
rest a bit, instead of laying on that floor, all
crowded up."</p>

<p>"Another night like this and I'll swear off for
good," said Mickey, as she sat up on the seat.</p>

<p>"Swear off what?" asked Evelyn.</p>

<p>"Well, off booze, for one thing."</p>

<p>"You swore off once before, didn't you?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
"Yeah&mdash;and that very night I was arrested in
El Paso for Vag."</p>

<p>"How long was you off liquor?"</p>

<p>"Till I got out of jail."</p>

<p>"How long was that?"</p>

<p>"Two hours."</p>

<p>The car was moving at a terrific rate of speed,
up grade, and down grade. "See if you see any
lights coming behind us," said Tony.</p>

<p>"We won't be able to tell until you reach the
top of the next grade, but I'll keep a sharp look-out,"
answered Evelyn, as she turned half around
in the seat.</p>

<p>"Just think," said Pearl, "This time last night
I was on this road about this time, but how different
it was."</p>

<p>"Well, I've been on this road plenty of times,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
and no two times have been alike," answered
Mickey.</p>

<p>"There's lights coming, Tony, but they are a
long ways back, and it may not be the police car,
anyhow."</p>

<p>"O.&nbsp;K., Ev, but I'll just keep moving pretty
fast."</p>

<p>"Listen, Ev, will you come over and stay with
me tonight?" asked Pearl.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't want to spend the rest of the
night alone&mdash;will you?"</p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<p>They came into the city limits, but there was
no sign of trouble. Tony slowed down to an ordinary
speed, so as not to attract attention.</p>

<p>"Listen&mdash;" said Mickey, "Why don't you two
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
come and spend the night at our place&mdash;we have
a furnished house, five rooms, three bedrooms,
living-room, kitchen, and all that goes with it&mdash;you
know the place, Ev, that little brick house me
and Betty rented out on Myrtle Avenue. What
do you say?"</p>

<p>"Whatever Pearl says is all O.&nbsp;K. with me,"
answered Evelyn.</p>

<p>"Well, I have something to drink out there."</p>

<p>"Good," said Pearl, quickly. "We'll go."</p>

<p>"Hey, Tony, you know where my joint is, don't
you?"</p>

<p>"I should, by this time. I've took you there
enough&mdash;when you was so lit you didn't know
where it was yourself."</p>

<p>They arrived at Mickey's place in a few minutes,
and it was just as Mickey had described it,
and very tastily furnished in pinks and blues, with
a faint odor of incense in the still, cool air.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
"Come on in, Tony, and have a drink," as the
girls got out of the car.</p>

<p>"O.&nbsp;K."</p>

<p>They went into the rooms, snapping on the
lights, then all heading for the kitchen by instinct.
Pearl called Evelyn aside&mdash;talking in low tones,
as Mickey got out the bottle of whiskey and set
it on the table.</p>

<p>"Help yourself, Tony, while I see what the
conference is about."</p>

<p>"What do you think?"</p>

<p>"What do I think about what?"</p>

<p>"About how much to pay Tony for his trouble
tonight," said Evelyn.</p>

<p>"Well," from Pearl. "If it hadn't been for him,
I don't know what we would have done, and I
think we should at least give him ten dollars
apiece&mdash;what do you think?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
"It's all right by me, and here's my ten to prove
it," as she dug the wet money out of her stocking.</p>

<p>Both Evelyn and Pearl dug into their clothes
from the neck, and produced the ten apiece.</p>

<p>"Tony," said Evelyn, as she turned to where
he was standing, "Will thirty bucks be all right
for your trouble tonight?"</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;nuts. Pay me my regular three bucks
and forget about the rest. You have to work
pretty hard for that money, and what's more, I
got a real kick out of that run tonight."</p>

<p>"The Hell you say," from Pearl. "You take
this dough&mdash;what do you think we are? I admit
I'm new down here, and you are a good scout,
but you ain't no friend of mine if you don't take
this," as she handed the money toward him.</p>

<p>"Girlie, you're a good scout, and I tell you
what I'll do. If it will make you feel any better,
I'll take it&mdash;but remember this&mdash;when you want
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
anything from me, or want me to take you any
place or do anything for you, and you ain't got
the dough&mdash;call me, and any time you need some
dough yourself&mdash;I know you girls run short lots
of times&mdash;don't forget&mdash;call me. Now, I'll be going,"
as he took his cap and started for the door.</p>

<p>"Good-bye," from all three girls.</p>

<p>"If I hear anything, I'll give you a ring on the
phone and tip you off," as he closed the door
behind him.</p>

<p>"Hell's Fire. Give me a drink, quick," said
Evelyn, as she began to undress where she stood.
"I've seen funny sights, but I would have loved
to have been a bystander and seen us three wading
across that river. It wasn't funny then, but
Mickey, when you come up out of that water, I
almost broke down, as dark as it was down there,
you was funny looking&mdash;" laughingly.</p>

<p>"It's a damn good thing Pearl had as good
hold on me as she had, or I'd been a goner."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
"Do you think there will be much of a stink
about this killing? You know, Irene is an American
citizen, and she was shot on the Mex side,"
said Pearl.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;" said Evelyn slowly, "You can't tell
just what will come of this. The real trouble will
come from Juan Moros' people, if there is any
trouble at all. His old man is a political power
down in that country&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That shows what you know about it," said
Mickey bitterly. "When anything happens to an
American outside of the U.&nbsp;S., it's just too bad.
When trouble starts down here the American
Consul is the first one to run for the bridge. Our
government figures that if you are out of your
own country, that's your business&mdash;and it's your
business to protect yourself. Look at Nicaragua,
Panama, Haiti, as well as our nearby Mexico.
When anyone of our American citizens are
knocked off, said government sends a note of apology
to our Consul, saying they are sorry&mdash;but
that don't bring your life back. Believe me, if
you are an American, and you're in some other
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
country, my advice is to keep your mouth shut,
or affect an English accent."</p>

<p>"Well, surely they will do something with that
woman that did the shooting," argued Pearl.</p>

<p>"But my God, Ev, she killed one of her own
people, and in cold blood."</p>

<p>"Yes, dear&mdash;he was a Mex, all right, but when
she tells the Mex judge how he broke her heart,
and how she found him in the arms of a milk-white
Gringo&mdash;it's a ten-to-one shot that the judge
will weep for her broken heart, and tell her that
she has done her country a favor&mdash;in shooting a
cur that would so scorn his own countrywoman."</p>

<p>"Well, you said that there might be trouble
from his people, that his father was a big Mex
politician."</p>

<p>"Well, in that case, if his father isn't tied up
at the present in some revolution of his own, he
may come here&mdash;or send one of his loyal men, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
cut Negro Noche loose from some of her vital
spots."</p>

<p>"I've been on some hot parties, and I've seen a
lot of things happen, but tonight takes the prize,"
mused Pearl.</p>

<p>"There's not much of the night left," said
Mickey. "Let's get to bed and sleep a little of
this off."</p>

<p>"Pearl, didn't I hear you say you had a date
with Big Boy this afternoon&mdash;to go swimming?"</p>

<p>"Yeah&mdash;he asked me, and you, too, Ev."</p>

<p>"Are you going?"</p>

<p>"Sure, might as well. I can't lose nothing&mdash;I'll
get up around noon and go over to the room, and
wait for him."</p>

<p>"You'll probably find him at the room waiting
for you, if I know anything about men, and if I
don't know anything about 'em, there ain't nobody
who does. Where did Mickey go?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
"I'm in bed," came from one of the bedrooms.
"You two pick out the bed you want to sleep in
and go to it when you are ready. Good night."</p>

<p>"Good night."</p>

<p>"Say, I'm ready to turn in now, are you,
Pearl?"</p>

<p>"Yeah&mdash;let's have another little drink before
we go to bed."</p>

<p>"That's my idea, too&mdash;a drink&mdash;and a big one,"
said Evelyn.</p>

<p>"Listen, Ev&mdash;when I made up my mind to come
down here, I only had one thought in mind, and
that was to stay a little while and make some
money, and get away while I could&mdash;you know
what I mean, to get&mdash;well, to get away before it
got me&mdash;do you know what I mean?"</p>

<p>"Sure, Kid, I know what you mean, only you're
too damn nice to say it for fear of hurting my
feelings. You mean to get away before you get
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
like me&mdash;and Mickey&mdash;and that gang you were
with tonight."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't quite mean it like that&mdash;I
mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Listen, honey, I know just how you feel&mdash;I
only hope you can do what you want to. When
I came down here, I had the same idea, but I let
this damn place get me. Now I couldn't leave it,
no matter how hard I tried. I guess the only way
I'll ever leave it is in a box."</p>

<p>"I don't quite know what to do. I'm kind of
puzzled since tonight&mdash;the party, the shooting,
and all. Maybe I've had a little too much to
drink&mdash;or not enough&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;well, I ought never,
never think, nobody should ever think, especially
about the past&mdash;Oh, well, let's have another
drink."</p>

<p>"Well, if you could be bothered with Big Boy,
you could feather your nest for good&mdash;honey, that
means an awful lot these days&mdash;not having to
worry about the rent, not having to put up with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
men that you hate the sight of, especially when
you have to be nice, to make the lousy two dollars
that they hand out grudgingly, and think
that they are doing you a good turn&mdash;but, of
course, if you can't go him&mdash;well, what's the use
to try?"</p>

<p>"I've been thinking about that myself&mdash;and I'm
afraid it wouldn't work out. First, I don't care
a thing about him, and he would be so jealous
of me my life wouldn't be safe, if he caught me
talking to anyone else, and knowing what I've
been, if he ever got mad at me he would be sure
to throw it up to me&mdash;and I'm afraid I couldn't
stand that."</p>

<p>"Well, if I'm not mistaken, you do care for
somebody else, don't you? And if my guess is
right&mdash;it's Harry, ain't it?"</p>

<p>"Yeah&mdash;you're right, all right, it's Harry. He
don't even know my name, and I don't know a
thing about him, but Jees, how I love that kid&mdash;Ah,
nuts, one would be as bad as the other; I
would be so jealous of Harry every time he was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
out of my sight for five minutes, I'd think he was
with some other woman, and what's more, I'd be
right&mdash;second, he is not the marrying kind, that
is, he don't marry my kind&mdash;that's damn certain.
Ah&mdash;to Hell with both of them, I'll take 'em all
on that's got the price. What the Hell am I mooning
about? Let's have another drink."</p>

<p>"O.&nbsp;K., we will have another drink, but Pearl,
you are only fooling yourself&mdash;you may say to
Hell with them for now, but when you get up
today, you will feel different about them. I know&mdash;I've
said the same thing every night for the
past five years. You can't settle it like that&mdash;if
it were only possible to settle one's feelings like
that it would make a lot of difference in people's
lives&mdash;tomorrow you will go on thinking you can
see Harry every night, and how you can chisel
Big Boy at the same time, without the other being
positive of just what you are doing&mdash;Honey, I
know what I'm talking about. Five years ago,
when I came to this border, I was the toast of the
town&mdash;I know I don't look it, but I was sure a
looker in those days, and I had my way any time
I wanted it&mdash;but I was just like you&mdash;I was going
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
to make a pile of dough, and make a getaway
while I could, and marry some good, honest, quiet
guy that would never suspect me of having been
what I was. Yeah&mdash;I was foolish, but&mdash;I guess
we are all foolish like that at times&mdash;Oh, God, if
I could only call back those five years, what
wouldn't I give, but what's the use, I've drawn
my own cards, it's up to me to play them. You
say you want to get out of this&mdash;then you take
the money you have, and what I've got, and you
catch the first train&mdash;don't wait&mdash;don't wait for
anything&mdash;most of all, don't wait for your own
thoughts to catch up with you&mdash;just go and go
quick, but you won't&mdash;what's the use&mdash;Oh,
what's the use."</p>

<p>"You're right, Ev, what's the use? But there's
one thing&mdash;I'm going to do the thing I originally
planned; I'm one Hooker that's going to get the
dough and make the getaway. I'm going to do
just what you suggested&mdash;I'm going to see Harry
every time I can, and I'm going to get all I can
off Big Boy&mdash;come on, let's get some sleep."</p>

<p>"Honey, I'm for you hook, line and sinker. I'll
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
also take the bottle and put it under the pillow
in case I wake up thirsty."</p>

<p>"You know, Ev, I've only known you for a
little over twenty-four hours, but it seems I've
known you for years, and you're a damn good
scout&mdash;good night."</p>

<p>"Good night, kid," said Evelyn, as she took a
nip from the bottle.</p>

<p>They went to bed, to sleep the sleep of the just,
and the hours slipped by as though they were
seconds, until&mdash;</p>

<p>"My God, what is that, a fire alarm?" asked
Evelyn, as she raised up in bed.</p>

<p>Pearl was still sleeping.</p>

<p>"It's that damn phone," growled Mickey, as
she stumbled to it. "Who the Hell could be calling
at this time of night&mdash;or day? Hello&mdash;what
do you want? What? Oh, it's you, Tony&mdash;what's
up? Oh, yeah, have they been able to trace the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
car, do you think? Do you think they will trace
you? Thanks, Tony, I'll see you later," as she
hung up.</p>

<p>"What's up," yelled Evelyn, from the bed.</p>

<p>"Well, for one thing, there's headlines in the
papers about the shooting last night, and Tony
said the police were down there this morning, and
questioned everybody on the place, and the boss
lied and said that Tony hadn't left the place between
twelve and six this morning. He says he
don't know if they suspect him or not, and the
police said there was only one woman in the car&mdash;so
they must be all balled up&mdash;what do you
think?"</p>

<p>"What's all the trouble, and what time is it?"
said Pearl, as she raised up in bed.</p>

<p>"It was Tony called," answered Evelyn. "What
time is it, Mickey, or is your time-piece working?"</p>

<p>"It's one-thirty," called Mickey from the
kitchen.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
"Oh, good Heavens, I must get to the room, I
don't even remember what time I had the date
with Big Boy."</p>

<p>"It don't matter what time you had the date
with him&mdash;he'll wait if you are late," from Evelyn,
as she climbed slowly out of bed. "Oh, my,
I'll never be the same. I'm so stiff I can hardly
stand up."</p>

<p>"You spent all of last night getting that way,"
said Mickey.</p>

<p>"Getting how?"</p>

<p>"Getting stiff."</p>

<p>"I know, Mickey dear, but the stiff I mean is
not the kind of stiff you mean."</p>

<p>"You better be careful, Ev," said Pearl. "You
might catch pneumonia from being in that river."</p>

<p>"You are wrong there&mdash;the only thing you will
catch from being in that river is hydrophobia, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
I think I had that when I was a virgin," laughed
Evelyn.</p>

<p>"Good Heavens, Ev," said Mickey, "Was you
ever a virgin?"</p>

<p>"Well, there has always been a doubt in my
mind about that&mdash;you see, if I ever was&mdash;it's been
so long ago my memory fails to recognize the
fact."</p>

<p>"It must be grand to be a virgin," from Pearl.</p>

<p>"Yeah&mdash;but think of the fun you miss," said
Mickey. "I sure remember the time I stopped
being a virgin, and do I remember the one who
put a stop to it!"</p>

<p>"What was he like?" asked Pearl. "And&mdash;what
was you like?"</p>

<p>"Well, I was a big, green, corn-fed country
girl, in the corn and Bible belt in Kansas, wasn't
hard to look at (of course, that's before I had all
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
these scars on this pan of mine)&mdash;and the guy&mdash;was
the son of the rural mail carrier, who had just
come out of the Navy, and what he knew was
plenty, and I had always read what devils sailors
were with the women&mdash;I guess I was just as curious
as he was ambitious. Come on in the kitchen
and I'll put the coffee on the stove, and finish my
confession."</p>

<p>"For God's sake, make that coffee strong&mdash;I
sure need it," said Evelyn, as she and Pearl followed
Mickey in the kitchen, and sat down at
the table. "Oh, I forgot&mdash;I'll get the cups and
saucers," as she rose from the table and went to
the cupboard.</p>

<p>"Go ahead with that dirty story you started to
tell us," said Pearl. "One of my pet weaknesses is
the true story of How, Why, and Where Trollops
like us three came from, and what caused it."</p>

<p>"Well, as I was saying, I was as green as they
come, and I had already spurned, so to speak, the
advances of the hired hand, which he made to me
one day in the barn. We drove to church as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
usual on Sunday, in the Goddamndest rig you
ever saw, a buckboard buggy with two horses.
Dad and Mother sat in the seat, and me, being
the only child, I stood up in the back and held on
to the seat, and there I was, with my skirt and
underskirts and drawers starched so stiff that
when I sat down it sounded like somebody breaking
macaroni in a cooking pot, hair done up in the
latest, two big buns over each ear&mdash;when I look
back at that now, I have all I can do to keep from
screaming with laughter at the way I must have
looked. Well, I was introduced to Jerry at the
church, and he asked me if he could take me home
in his buggy&mdash;that is, it was his old man's buggy
that he had borrowed for the purpose. Mother
and Dad thought it would be lovely if he drove
me home, so they went on ahead when church
was over, and left me with Jerry. Of course, him
having been places and seen and done things, I
was a pushover for him. When I look back at it,
I must have been a panic. He drove off the main
road, and said we should tie the horse, and go
for a lovely walk under the trees. I was timid at
first, as we sat on the ground under an old pine
tree. He kissed me, and I wasn't so keen on it,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
then he took me in his arms, and it done something
to me, and I came right back at him. In my ignorance
I decided that I would show him that us
country girls was just as up to date as any of
those girls he met in foreign countries, and I
stopped at nothing&mdash;well, that was the memorable
time when I stopped being a virgin."</p>

<p>"I bet that was a sight," said Evelyn.</p>

<p>"And how," from Pearl.</p>

<p>"Ah, damn, that coffee would boil over&mdash;hey,
Ev, get the cream out of the ice-box, will you?"</p>

<p>"I'll get it," said Pearl, as she rose from the
table. "You haven't told us what happened after
that afternoon."</p>

<p>"There's not a lot more to tell. Jerry got an
awful crush on me, so I thought&mdash;he came after
me every evening or so, and took me for a drive&mdash;and
a walk, as well, and three months after
that first Sunday afternoon I began to blow up
like somebody had been using a bicycle pump on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
me, and then Jerry decided to re-enlist&mdash;which he
did do, without even saying good-bye&mdash;shortly
after that my father found out all the dirt, and he
literally put his foot against my dainty behind, and
kicked me out, that being the proper thing to do
to a wayward daughter in the Bible belt, and me,
I went from bad to worse, and then to Kansas
City&mdash;and by that time I had learned to step, and
did I use to burn Twelfth Street up. I'd start at
the old Gaiety Theatre, on 12th and Wyandotte
Street, and on down 12th to McGee Street, then
back on the other side of the street. Sometimes
I'd be a long time making the round, but I made
the money. That was in the days when Kansas
City was good&mdash;a girl could easily make twenty
bucks in a night of hard labor, besides what you
could roll a guy for when he went to sleep&mdash;but
eventually the police gave me the works in the
form of a floater out of town, and I floated to
Denver. Boy, Oh boy, will I ever forget Denver?
Many's the pair of heels I wore off on Curtis
Street and many's the dollar I've earned there&mdash;and
from there to many places, till I arrived here,
and this will probably be my finish&mdash;but what the
Hell, drink your coffee."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
"In that case, you blame the cause of your&mdash;well&mdash;the
cause of this life, on a man, then," from
Evelyn.</p>

<p>"I can't say I do&mdash;I'm what I am because I
wanted to be&mdash;I need men. When I went to
Kansas City, I could have found a job of some
kind, and worked like thousands of girls do, but
I didn't want to. I've never wanted to be what
is called decent. I think that a life like that would
be damn slow, and it's not in my nature to live
like that. I love all this excitement&mdash;all this uncertainty,
and most of all, I could never be true
to one man, because&mdash;well, because when I see a
man that arouses my interest, I could never resist
the impulse to satisfy my curiosity, so&mdash;what good
would I be with a husband&mdash;I'd only make the
poor guy miserable, or else cause him to kill me&mdash;I
know me, like no one else does."</p>

<p>"You are right there, Mickey," said Pearl. "No
girl ever went the wrong way unless she wanted
to&mdash;she may cry and say that a man made her
what she is, and that she would never have been
so unless some man tricked her&mdash;but down deep
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
in her heart she wanted to be what she is. No
girl was ever really raped&mdash;unless she helped the
process along a little. The girls who have been
raped, and really in their hearts didn't want to
be, were the only ones that have been found dead,
after an awful fight. No man can really rape a
girl who doesn't want to be raped just a little.
I know from actual experience."</p>

<p>"You're both right," said Evelyn, as she
reached for the coffee pot, for her second cup of
coffee. "This coffee hits me right where I sit this
morning&mdash;it sure tastes good."</p>

<p>"Well, I gotta get dressed and start for town.
I gotta date with Big Boy, but I can't for the life
of me remember what time it was for. What are
you going to do tonight, Ev?"</p>

<p>"I suppose I'll do the usual thing&mdash;go over the
bridge."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose there will be anything said
to us about last night?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
"I don't see how they can say anything&mdash;we
weren't caught doing anything, and there's no
proof that we were mixed up in that mess, and
we weren't caught coming over the border, so&mdash;what
can they say?"</p>

<p>"Yeah&mdash;I guess you're right at that&mdash;well, I'll
see you later," as she started for the door.</p>

<p>"But where?" called Evelyn.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what&mdash;you come over to my hotel,
Ev, about six o'clock. How is that, and we'll go
to supper&mdash;oh, by the way, Mickey, what are you
doing tonight&mdash;the usual thing?"</p>

<p>"Sure&mdash;the usual thing, but I'll see you over
on the other side," answered Mickey.</p>

<p>"Then I'll be over at your hotel at six," said
Evelyn.</p>

<p>"O.&nbsp;K., Ev, see you then&mdash;and thanks, Mickey,
for the hospitality. So long," as she closed the
door behind her.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
"That girl's sure a real good scout, Mickey&mdash;it's
too bad that she has got to go the route."</p>

<p>"Let's have a little drink&mdash;what do you say,
Ev?"</p>

<p>"Quick."</p>

<p>"Say, Ev, where did you meet Pearl?"</p>

<p>"On the car the other night&mdash;and right away
that Big Boy falls head over heels for her in a big
way, and wants to marry her, and she can't see
him&mdash;but&mdash;she is nuts over Harry Hicks&mdash;ain't
that something to tie your bowels in a knot?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Jees, Harry will do to her what he has
done to all the rest that's come his way&mdash;he will
get tired of her as quick as the rest, and then I
suppose she will grieve, and go on the usual drunk,
to forget it. I don't know what it is about that
guy that makes these girls go for him like they
do."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
"Yeah&mdash;and look at the dough she could get
from that big guy."</p>

<p>"I sure wish I could get my hooks into that
Big Boy for a couple of days, but he won't even
give me a tumble," as they went on sipping their
coffee.</p>

<p>When Pearl arrived at her hotel, she found Big
Boy sitting in the lobby, with a sour expression on
his face, which brightened when she came in.</p>

<p>"Hello, Big Boy," said Pearl, "Did you think
I was going to stand you up?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I forgot what time our date was for, so
I came at noon, and they said you hadn't been
in all night. Where have you been?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;now, is that nice, to ask me where I've
been, and what do you care where I've been? I'm
here for our date, am I not? Isn't that enough?
Come on up to the room, while I get dressed for
wherever it is we are going?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
Big Boy followed Pearl into the elevator and
to her room, without saying a word. When she
closed the door, then he turned to her, face red
with anger.</p>

<p>"I know where you've been&mdash;look at that dress&mdash;I
know you was one of the women who waded
the river last night. I suppose you went and spent
the night with the guy that helped you across."</p>

<p>"Listen, Big Boy, what ever gave you the notion
that you had the right to question where I've
been, and who I've been with? Get a load of
this&mdash;there is no man, woman or child that has
a right to talk to me like that, see&mdash;so don't you
try it."</p>

<p>"Well, what was you doing in Juarez that you
couldn't have come across the bridge before
twelve, and why was it so necessary for you to
come back over here that you would take the
chance of wading the river to get here?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;well&mdash;I just didn't make the bridge, and
I&mdash;well, I was afraid to stay over there all night."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
"You're lying like Hell, and you know it. You
was on that party last night at the Rio Bravo&mdash;"
as he came over to where she was standing.</p>

<p>"I was invited over there, but I didn't go,"
said Pearl, timidly.</p>

<p>"Stop that lying&mdash;you was invited all right&mdash;and
you went, and when that shooting happened,
you thought you better beat it. Who was with
you?" as he moved closer, "Where was Evelyn?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," lied Pearl.</p>

<p>"Now, you listen to me&mdash;I don't care what you
do, or where you go, see&mdash;but don't lie to me,"
as he took hold of her, "You are the first woman
in my life I have ever asked to marry me&mdash;and
get this&mdash;if I can't have you, nobody else will&mdash;I
mean it."</p>

<p>"You turn loose of me&mdash;I don't see what right
you have to treat me this way, because I've been
nice to you, you think I belong to you body and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
soul. Well, you let go of me, and get out. Who
do you think you are?"</p>

<p>"Oh, so that's the way you want it&mdash;well&mdash;what
I said goes&mdash;if I can't have you, there's no
other bastard will get you," as he punched her
in the eye.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;help&mdash;help&mdash;you lousy tramp, get out of
this room," screamed Pearl. "God damn you,
don't think you can get away with that kind of
stuff with me."</p>

<p>"Oh, Pearl&mdash;Pearl, please forgive me&mdash;I'll
never do that again. Oh, honest, kid, I let my
temper get away from me&mdash;Oh, please listen to
me. I didn't mean it&mdash;if I didn't think so much
of you I wouldn't have done it," as he took her
in his arms, while she sobbed violently, and let
him hold her close. "I'll call a doctor and have
him fix the eye up so it won't get black," as he
held her away from him, and then went to the
phone.</p>

<p>"Oh, Jees&mdash;" sobbed Pearl. "It's too late, my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
eye is already swelling shut&mdash;Oh, what a sight I'll
be," as she threw herself on the bed, kicking her
feet and crying loudly.</p>

<p>Big Boy called the doctor, and was told he
would be there at once, then he threw himself
on the bed beside Pearl, taking her in his arms,
kissing her and trying to stop her from crying.</p>

<p>"You see, you don't trust me&mdash;then you call
me a liar&mdash;and then you beat me," said Pearl,
between sobs, as she thought, "I'll put on a real
show for him, I'll make him shell out some dough
for this."</p>

<p>"Oh, honey, can't you see I'm crazy about you&mdash;honestly
nuts for you? If I didn't love you, I
wouldn't be jealous of you, would I? I'll never
do that again&mdash;will you believe me&mdash;let me get
you a glass of water&mdash;please don't cry&mdash;come on,
straighten up&mdash;the doctor will be here in a minute,"
as he held her in his arms.</p>

<p>A rap came on the door.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
"Come in," called Big Boy, as he got off the
bed, "Oh, hello, Doc&mdash;I want you to fix this eye
for Miss Jones&mdash;she had a little accident."</p>

<p>The doctor walked over to the bed, stooped
over Pearl, and looked at her eye, already swollen
shut, and turning a deep blue.</p>

<p>"That's a peach," said the doctor, "How did
you get it?"</p>

<p>"I was coming in the door, doctor, and I dropped
my key on the floor, and as I stooped over to
pick it up, I hit my eye on the door-knob," lied
Pearl.</p>

<p>"Well, it's the first door-knob I've ever seen
that left knuckle prints," laughed the doctor, as
he went to work to fix the eye.</p>

<p>"How long will it be black, doctor?" asked
Pearl.</p>

<p>"Oh, about a week or so, and then it will be
as good as ever."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
"Ah, gee, that's tough," said Big Boy awkwardly
as he backed towards the door, "I'll be
back in a minute," as he left the room.</p>

<p>"Will I have to wear a bandage over the eye
until it gets all right?"</p>

<p>"No, you don't have to wear a bandage at all,
unless you want to, but you know a bandage
covers a multitude of sins. You can say you got
a piece of glass in your eye, and that way you
won't have to stay in your room for a week until
it gets well."</p>

<p>"Ah, gee, Doc, you're a peach, thanks," as she
got off the bed.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be going now," as he gathered up
his things. "Next time tell your boy friend to
hit you some place it won't show," as he went
out the door.</p>

<p>Pearl lay on the bed&mdash;there was nothing else
to do. Now she couldn't very well go to Juarez,
with her eye bandaged up. No matter what lie
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
she told, nobody would believe it. Maybe it was
just as well not to go over for a few days anyhow&mdash;let
some of the trouble of the shooting die down,
and that would be time enough, but she couldn't
stay in the room all that time&mdash;she would go
crazy. She arose from the bed, went to the phone,
and called Evelyn's apartment and left a message
for her to call as soon as she came in.</p>

<p>The door opened slowly, as Big Boy came in,
loaded with candy and fruit and flowers.</p>

<p>"My God, what all have you got there?" asked
Pearl, as she looked at him with the one good eye.</p>

<p>"Some little things you might like, Pearl. You
can have anything you want, no matter what it is.
Will you please forgive me?"</p>

<p>"Well, it will take a lot more than candy or
flowers to make me forget a sock like that."</p>

<p>"Ah, gee, honey&mdash;you can have anything you
want&mdash;just name it. Let me get you a nice apartment,
and some clothes, open an account for
you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>&mdash;just
anything to show you I do really love you,
and I only want you to marry me&mdash;will you?"</p>

<p>"No, I won't marry you&mdash;but I'll think about
the apartment and the other stuff you mentioned."</p>

<p>"Ah, that's great&mdash;I gotta go now&mdash;I gotta
meet a guy on some business about the mine&mdash;I'll
be back tonight."</p>

<p>"Aw&mdash;alright, go ahead&mdash;I'll be here when you
get back&mdash;you've seen to that, all right," as he
came over to kiss her&mdash;"Never mind kissing me&mdash;I'm
still mad."</p>

<p>"I love you&mdash;can't you understand that," as
he took her in his arms.</p>

<p>A rap came on the door.</p>

<p>"Who's there," called Pearl.</p>

<p>"It's me&mdash;Ev," came the voice.</p>

<p>"Come on in."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
"My God&mdash;what's happened to you&mdash;your eye&mdash;what's
happened?" asked Evelyn, breathlessly.</p>

<p>"Well, you see, it was like this," said Big Boy.</p>

<p>"Never mind&mdash;never mind&mdash;I get it&mdash;she was
late for the date and you socked her for it&mdash;ain't
you the big bully?" said Evelyn, as she walked
over to Pearl.</p>

<p>"I just lost my temper, and I didn't mean to."</p>

<p>"You said you had to go&mdash;well, go ahead&mdash;I
want to talk to Ev."</p>

<p>"Will you be here when I get back?" asked
Big Boy anxiously.</p>

<p>"Yeah&mdash;she'll be here, all right, thanks to you&mdash;scram&mdash;"
answered Evelyn, as he went out the
door.</p>

<p>"My God, this thing hurts," said Pearl, as she
put her hands to her head.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
"What happened?"</p>

<p>"Oh, we got into an argument about last night,
and he was furious, and just took a punch at me,
that's all."</p>

<p>"Well, what was you saying?"</p>

<p>"He wanted to know about last night&mdash;and I
was lying and trying not to tell him anything, and
he seemed to know that I was lying, so he gives
me the shiner."</p>

<p>"Didn't I tell you about that guy&mdash;I told you
not to try to kid him, or lie to him. He is the
meanest louse that ever lived when he loses his
temper, and if you go ahead and play around with
him, you won't only get another black eye, but
you'll get a beating, and one that you will remember.
I know him, and I also know his reputation.
It's like I said&mdash;that guy is a killer, and if you go
on fooling with him, and he ever catches you
with Harry, he'll kill you as sure as you're born.
I'm not saying I told you so, or any of that stuff.
Heavens knows I know what it is to have a black
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
eye, and it's no fun, but remember what I'm saying&mdash;I
suppose he rushed out and bought this
stuff to get you to overlook the sock, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yeah&mdash;that's what he bought it for, and he
also is going to get me an apartment, and some
new clothes&mdash;he said I could have anything I
want&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, you better take sparingly, because, sister,
you will pay in the end. You let that guy go
do all that, and you don't stay true to him, it's
curtains for you&mdash;I'm telling you, because when
he finds you are hot for Harry, he'll go up in
smoke anyhow. He and Harry are the best of
friends, but they are rivals as well. I'm dying for
a drink&mdash;I'll bet you haven't got a drop around
here, have you?"</p>

<p>"Look in the top dresser drawer&mdash;there's a full
bottle that hasn't been opened."</p>

<p>"Thank Heavens&mdash;that's a life saver," as she
fished the bottle out of the drawer, and opening
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
it, took a long, deep drink. "Want one too, don't
you?</p>

<p>"Might as well," said Pearl, as she raised up
and took the bottle Evelyn handed her.</p>

<p>"Maybe I'm nuts, but I can't figure it out&mdash;here
is a guy that wants you to marry him, and
you can't see him for Harry. Ah, Hell&mdash;give me
another drink&mdash;the world's all haywire."</p>

<p>"Hell, I'm not going to stay in this room all
day. I want to go out, at least for a little while.
I know, Ev&mdash;let's you and I go get an apartment&mdash;you
come with me and help me hunt."</p>

<p>"Why go hunting apartments? If you really
want to be swell, then take an apartment in the
Hussman Hotel. They got the swellest in this
town, and there's no use taking anything but the
swellest, since Big Boy is going to pay the bill."</p>

<p>"That's an idea&mdash;I'll do it&mdash;you are all wrong
about me taking sparingly&mdash;I might as well have
whole hog or none, because he won't figure that,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
in case there is a big showdown. If I have to pay
the price, I might as well make it worth while,
ain't I right?"</p>

<p>"Yeah&mdash;I guess you're right, at that, because
when he does start mopping the town up with
you, he won't figure what he has spent&mdash;he will
just figure you have been a louse, and you will
get it&mdash;and how!"</p>

<p>"I'll change this dress and we will go," as she
started to strip again.</p>

<p>"Gee, I'm sorry you won't be able to go across
the border tonight. I hate to go over there alone."</p>

<p>"Don't worry, you won't be alone&mdash;I'm not the
first Hooker that has sported a black eye in this
burg. I'm going over&mdash;to Hell with what that
crowd thinks. I've got a sucker on the string
that's not so bad, so let's have the fun while we
can. Give me that bottle, darling, I need it
badly."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
"Damn if you ain't the best pal I've had in a
long time, Pearl."</p>

<p>"You ain't so bad yourself, Ev."</p>

<p>They left the hotel, also a note on the door,
saying they would be back shortly, as they had
gone apartment hunting. They moseyed by the
Plaza, and over to the Hussman, where they
looked at apartments, which ended in Pearl taking
one.</p>

<p>"This is some hot-looking joint," said Evelyn,
as she sat down, gorgeously putting on the Ritz,
"If I'm going to come up here to see you I might
as well start putting on the dog right now."</p>

<p>"Come up and see me&mdash;you&mdash;you're going to
move up here with me."</p>

<p>"Like Hell&mdash;I'll come up and see you, but I
ain't moving in here&mdash;I don't want to have to
jump out of one of these windows some night
when you and Big Boy have one of your grudge
fights&mdash;I'll stay where I'm at."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
"Come on, let's go back to the hotel, and I'll
get my things packed, and start to move&mdash;will
you help me?"</p>

<p>"Sure, why not?"</p>

<p>They went back to the hotel, and found Big
Boy waiting for them.</p>

<p>"Did you find the kind of a place you want?"
he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>"Did I? Did I? I went to the Hussman and
picked the best in the joint&mdash;is that all right?"</p>

<p>"Right," he smiled, "And the best is none too
good."</p>

<p>"I'm going to pack and move right now, Ev,
and you are going to help me."</p>

<p>"No, you call the maid and let her pack your
things, and send them over. Here's a little present
I have for you," as he handed her a small
book.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
"Oh, that's wonderful&mdash;now I'll forgive you
for the black eye. Look, Ev, my own bank book,
and already a thousand dollars to check on&mdash;Ah,
gee, that's swell, Big Boy," as she gave him a
peck on the cheek for a kiss.</p>

<p>"How would you and Ev like to go to a show
for the rest of the afternoon?" asked Big Boy.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't mind if I can have a few more
drinks before I go in," said Evelyn.</p>

<p>"I'm all fixed for that," he answered, as he
took a pint out of his hip pocket.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you, Pearl, you kill a third, and you
kill a third, and I'll kill the rest. How's that?"
said Evelyn, as she took the bottle from Big Boy.</p>

<p>"Why just the pint? I've a quart in the other
dresser&mdash;wait, I'll get it," as she went to the
dresser and took out a quart of Kentucky Bourbon.</p>

<p>"Why not kill both?" suggested Evelyn.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
"Did you say you wanted to see the picture,
or just want to go in the theatre to sleep?" asked
Big Boy.</p>

<p>"Well, we'll get a bigger kick out of it, if we
are stiff; I know we will."</p>

<p>"I've a better idea than that," said Pearl. "Let's
just kill the quart, then take the pint into the
theatre, and have a nip during the picture, huh,
what do you say?"</p>

<p>"It don't matter where I drink it, as long as I
drink, let's get started&mdash;Big Boy, you drink first,
then you Pearl, then I'll knock the rest of it off,"
suggested Evelyn.</p>

<p>"Oke," answered Big Boy, as he turned the
bottle up to his mouth, while deep gurgling
sounds came forth.</p>

<p>The quart was finished, and all went to the
theatre, as Pearl left orders with the maid to pack
her things, and have them sent to the Hussman.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
The afternoon papers carried warnings to all
Americans that the long-expected rebellion in
Mexico had broken out in Durango, and that the
administration of Portes Gil, Mexico's President,
looked as though it were at an end.</p>

<p>Portes Gil was at a loss&mdash;his troops could not
seem to do anything&mdash;there was only one thing
for him to do, and that was to recall ex-President
Calles, known as the Iron Man of Mexico, to help
in breaking the rebellion.</p>

<p>Juarez, with its large garrison of soldiers, was
at a nervous tension, and the bar owners were
twice as nervous, not knowing how long the garrison
would be loyal to the Federals, as all that is
necessary to change their loyalty is to shoot the
commanding officers, and declare they were loyal
to the other side, which is so often the case when
the opposing side is much larger, or when there
is a little looting to be done.</p>

<p>Fort Bliss, with its rows of beautiful two-story
brick houses for its officers, its large brick barracks,
housing its hundreds of men, and small,
newly built brick bungalows for its petty officers,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
its tremendous stables housing its hundreds of
horses, its enormous parade and drill grounds,
clean as a freshly swept floor, aroused from its
lethargy at the rumors of war. The men were
raring to be let loose to fight, anybody or anything,
as long as it promised excitement and fight.</p>

<p>"It sure looks like a hot time in the old town
soon," said Evelyn, as she lay back and stretched
out on the beautifully appointed divan in Pearl's
new apartment.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute until I change the bandage on
this bum eye, and you can read the newspaper to
me," said Pearl, from the bathroom.</p>

<p>"Why don't you leave the bandage off when
you are in the house? There's nothing you can
put on it now that will take the black out of it&mdash;just
leave it alone, and when you start to go out,
then stick the patch over it."</p>

<p>"That's a good idea, I'll do it," as she sat down
in front of Evelyn. "Now, tell me more, what
the paper says about war."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
"The American Consul says in a statement in
the paper that he cannot be responsible
for American citizens who go over to Juarez just
to have a good time, and that only those who
have business and have to go over are the only
ones to go over&mdash;Well, in my business it's necessary
for me to go over&mdash;but you having a man
who has money, on the string, you don't have to
go over&mdash;but I can see by the expression in the
one good eye of yours that you will have important
business in Juarez&mdash;will you not, Miss
Jones?" said Evelyn, with mock elegance.</p>

<p>"With all this excitement brewing I should stay
up here in the apartment, and act like a lady.
Now's the time to go over there and raise Hell&mdash;with
the revolution coming on, they will have
forgotten about the shooting, and will be so taken
up with other things, it will be as safe as ever,
if you can ever call Juarez safe."</p>

<p>The telephone started ringing madly&mdash;"Who
the Hell can that be?" asked Pearl, as she went
to answer it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
"Hello&mdash;Oh, yeah&mdash;yeah, I hear you all right.
You have to go right now&mdash;well, when will you
be back?&mdash;Oh, gee, I'm sorry&mdash;well, is there anything
you want me to do?&mdash;sure, I'll be careful&mdash;will
you be safe in that territory? That is where
most of the fighting will be, so the paper says&mdash;Oh,
that's why you have to go down there&mdash;I
didn't get that last crack&mdash;come again&mdash;don't
mind if I go over to Juarez with Evelyn, and have
a few drinks, do you? I can go, but you would
rather I wouldn't? And have a drink whenever I
want, too&mdash;No, I'm not mad&mdash;why should I be
mad? But why should I go into the sisterhood
just because you will be out of town for a few
days? Oh, it might be weeks&mdash;well, you are going
of your own free will&mdash;nobody is making you
go&mdash;Oh, Hell, yes, certainly I've enough money
till you get back&mdash;yes, O.&nbsp;K., goodbye," as she
hung up the receiver.</p>

<p>"What did I tell you?" said Evelyn. "He has
to go to the mine and wants you to be the sweet
and innocent one till he gets back&mdash;that guy is
so jealous of you he smells bad&mdash;what are you
going to do tonight?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
"Well, I was thinking it would be grand to go
over to Juarez, and before the bridge closes, bring
our own gang here for a party&mdash;what do you
think?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear&mdash;Harry will like your new apartment&mdash;you
ain't kidding me, I'm wise&mdash;and
what's more, I'm staying here myself tonight with
a boy friend&mdash;that is, if I can pick up one that is
young enough to come without his wheel chair."</p>

<p>"All right&mdash;let's get started&mdash;wait till I put
the patch on the bum eye."</p>

<p>"If anybody asks you how you got the eye,
what are you going to tell them?"</p>

<p>"Tell them the truth&mdash;they won't believe it
anyhow."</p>

<p>"I never thought of that before, and the way
I've worried over trying to think up a grand lie
to tell someone when, if you were to tell the
truth it would be just as good, because they would
never believe it, anyhow. That is a new idea, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
I won't have to think so much now&mdash;Hooray&mdash;let
us drink&mdash;Oh, damn it&mdash;there ain't no more
whiskey."</p>

<p>"Never mind, dear, we will soon be in Juarez,"
said Pearl, as she pulled the hat down over the
patch on her eye.</p>

<p>"The way you have that hat on, you would
hardly notice that eye," remarked Evelyn, as she
arranged her dress.</p>

<p>"Don't you worry, that herd of hawk-eyed
whores will see it long before I get there. Any
time some woman's man socks her in the eye, it
travels by mental telepathy&mdash;not that they have
any mental capacity, but even the most lowly animal
has instinct&mdash;therefore they would know it."</p>

<p>"Oh, sister, thou speaketh the truth&mdash;thou wilt
be blessed," said Evelyn, lifting her hands to
Heaven, "Come, Juarez calleth."</p>

<p>They boarded the Juarez-bound car, and as the
car stopped for the Customs and Immigration
offi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>cials
of Mexico to get on, more than usual boarded
the car, questioning everybody as to their reason
for going over the border,&mdash;the extra questioning
was because of the revolution having started.</p>

<p>"For what reason, Senorita, are you going to
Juarez tonight?" one of the men asked Pearl.</p>

<p>"I'm going over to see a friend on business,"
answered Pearl.</p>

<p>"What manner of business, Senorita?"</p>

<p>"About a job he promised me."</p>

<p>"And you, Senorita Evelyn, why are you going
over tonight?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;to be damn truthful, Senor, I'm going
over for a drink," answered Evelyn.</p>

<p>"That is a very good reason, Senorita&mdash;Gratias!"</p>

<p>The men moved slowly through the car, going
through every bundle and package, regardless of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
size, whether it be large or small, making men
stand up, and feeling them over for firearms, finally
leaving the car to ramble its way on to town.</p>

<p>"My Heavens, they are particular tonight," said
Pearl.</p>

<p>"They will be that way until the war is over,
and what good it does, I don't know," answered
Evelyn.</p>

<p>Juarez, since the reports of the war, and the
warning for Americans to stay on their own side,
there were twice as many people in the bars as
there usually were at this hour of the evening.
They stayed on the car until they arrived at the
Lobby No. 2, where they got off the car, with
Pearl holding her head down so that no one might
see the black eye.</p>

<p>"I wonder what Harry will say when he sees
my shiner?"</p>

<p>"Black eyes are nothing new to Harry."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
They went into the bar&mdash;crowds were milling,
singing, talking, cursing and drinking to the war.</p>

<p>"This is going to be another wild night over
here&mdash;I can see that already&mdash;come on, let's get
a drink, and then you can go in and see Harry."</p>

<p>"O.&nbsp;K."</p>

<p>"Well, for the love of Jees&mdash;what happened to
you?" asked Mickey, as she came up to Pearl.
"You needn't tell me&mdash;Big Boy&mdash;ain't I right?"</p>

<p>"Right&mdash;what are you drinking, Mickey?"
asked Pearl.</p>

<p>"Whiskey&mdash;but how did it happen, and when?"</p>

<p>"Well, he is jealous of me&mdash;and he knew I was
lying about last night, and so&mdash;he took a sock
at me."</p>

<p>"Ah, that's lousy."</p>

<p>"Yeah&mdash;that's lousy, but she got returns at
once," said Evelyn. "She has already moved to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
the Hussman, and what an apartment&mdash;and then
the boy friend came in and handed her a bank
book all her own, with a grand for her to check
on&mdash;then he goes away tonight to the mine, and
Pearl is going to be true to him till he comes back&mdash;like
Hell."</p>

<p>"Well, that calls for celebration," said Mickey,
as she drank her whiskey.</p>

<p>"It does," answered Pearl. "I think we should
do it tonight, after the bridge closes&mdash;what do you
say?"</p>

<p>"Good&mdash;I'll be there, but I ain't telling anyone
about it&mdash;you do your own telling&mdash;I might invite
someone you don't want&mdash;well, I got a date
to roll a guy&mdash;I'll be seeing you," as she went
into the crowd.</p>

<p>"Mickey is a damn good scout," said Pearl.</p>

<p>"She's regular," answered Evelyn.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
"Oh, listen&mdash;that's Harry singing&mdash;come on in
and let's sit at a table and see the show&mdash;I could
watch him all night."</p>

<p>"You probably will&mdash;but he won't be singing."</p>

<p>"Now, Ev, you shouldn't begrudge me a little
pleasure&mdash;at least Harry never gave me a black
eye."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;and from all I hear, he ain't got much of
what you're crazy about, to give, either."</p>

<p>"Do you believe all you hear, Ev?"</p>

<p>"Well, I can't say that I do&mdash;but I have no
reason to doubt the rumor, unless you care to
enlighten me on the subject."</p>

<p>"Well, darling, you use your imagination&mdash;and
sign my name to it."</p>

<p>"Really."</p>

<p>"Surest thing, Ev."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
"Don't tell me I've missed something."</p>

<p>"I think you have."</p>

<p>"Well, it's really too late now&mdash;all I can do is
be sorry."</p>

<p>"You see, Ev&mdash;what I really like about Harry
is his&mdash;well, his way."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;REALLY," said Evelyn, eyes wide.</p>

<p>"That's what it is."</p>

<p>"Well, I admit I've always suspected Harry."</p>

<p>"What?" said Pearl.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing," smiled Evelyn, "But that calls
for another drink&mdash;waiter, whiskey, quick."</p>

<p>"I'll have one, too&mdash;pronto."</p>

<p>They drank the whiskey, and crowded their
way into the cabaret, and back near the band
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
stand, where they found an unoccupied table, that
commanded a good view of the show.</p>

<p>"I'll be with you in a few minutes," said Harry,
as he passed their table.</p>

<p>"Just a minute&mdash;Ladies and Gentlemen&mdash;I have
some news&mdash;I've been requested by the management
to read for your benefit," said Harry, as he
silenced the crowd, then continued reading from
a yellow piece of paper in his hand: "The Rebels
have taken Chihuahua City, and are organizing
more troops for the march on Juarez."</p>

<p>The crowd was silent; not a sound or a word
for several minutes, then the sounds started, with
low whispers, then rose to the usual loud singing,
talking, dancing, still rising higher and noisier,
until the gaiety was at the point of hysteria.</p>

<p>Mexicans stole sly glances at each other, some
very serious and worried, others not noticing or
caring that the rebels were going to march on
Juarez, and others wondering which side to stick
to, as the winning side is always the best, and if
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
the rebels had taken Chihuahua City, Juarez
would be nothing.</p>

<p>Americans who ordinarily came over the border
every night to have their little drink and waste
a few hours, and go home practically as sober
as they came over, were drinking with the best of
the lot, as they knew that if the fighting was to
take place in the city, as it had done before, there
would be no chance to come over and have the
usual drink; therefore drink all that was possible
while the drinking was good; others, who remained
gentlemen, whether drunk or sober, were
making asses of themselves in huge form, and there
is nothing that can be so perfect an ass as an
American in a country other than his own, and
with a mind made up to show off; hence, hilarity
in its most violent form held sway for the rest
of the night, cars and drunken people so numerous
on the International Bridge it would be impossible
for the gates to be closed before at least one
o'clock, and the Customs and Immigration Officials
dared not close the bridge until those that
were dragging themselves and others were across,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
as it was possible that the Rebels would take a
train, or an engine with a caboose, and in one of
their moments of madness, which are many in the
Mexican temperament, and leave Chihuahua City
without the rest of the Rebel army, and just cause
enough for a fight, to kill some innocent bystander,
which is a known fact, that in a battle in Mexico
there are more people killed by accident than with
actual intent, as they are very bad shots, but if
they ever work up enough courage to come close
enough for a hand-to-hand fight, they either do it
with knives, or call the whole thing off and go
into the nearest bar, and have a drink. It is not
an unusual thing to see the Federal army and the
Rebel army call off the fighting for lunch and the
usual noon siesta, and a general get-together, and
congratulate each other on the bravery of the
things they have seen done, or have heard of.
Knowing this, and knowing that when the fighting
did start in Juarez, that there would be as
many bullets fall on the American side as on the
Mexican side, Fort Bliss had already stationed a
troop of men at the foot of the Santa Fe Bridge;
consequently, with all the ribaldry the bridge had
to be kept open until nearly two o'clock.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
Thrill seekers and tourists who were out to see
everything and experience everything, stayed in
Juarez that night, hoping to see some fighting and
have first-hand information to tell the folks back
in Kansas, or Ohio, just what it was like, and with
the usual intelligence, which isn't above that of a
stray cur, thinking it possible to witness a battle,
but expecting that, owing to the fact that they
were American citizens, that the Mexicans would
watch where they were shooting, and not a hair
on them would be harmed.</p>

<p>Men whose wives in their drunken stupor
wanted to stay in Juarez; men with women that
they had picked up, but were too drunk to walk,
were thrown over their shoulders, and carried like
a bag of meal to the American side of the bridge;
drunken women helping women more drunk than
they, with the occasional leaning over the side of
the bridge to let off some of the last of the liquid
cargo they had taken on at the last bar.</p>

<p>Pearl, Evelyn and Mickey were among the last
to come across, with Pearl and Mickey leading
Evelyn, who was too drunk to make it alone.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
"Ev, you should never get this drunk," said
Mickey.</p>

<p>"Who are you, sister? I'll get as drunk as I
like," mumbled Evelyn.</p>

<p>"What I'd like to know is how much she drank
to get this drunk. I've seen her kill a quart at a
time, and never phase her, but my God, she must
have got to a barrel this time," said Pearl.</p>

<p>"Let go of me&mdash;I can walk alone," said Evelyn,
as she pulled away from them.</p>

<p>"Do you think you can, Ev?"</p>

<p>"Sure," said Evelyn, as she staggered to the
curb, vomiting down her entire front.</p>

<p>"There she goes; now she will feel better as
soon as she gets some of that stuff out of her,"
said Mickey.</p>

<p>"Yeah&mdash;but we better hold her, she might fall,"
but she was too late; Evelyn was already lying in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
the gutter. "What a sight she will be now&mdash;come
on, Mickey, let's get her up to my hotel&mdash;call a
taxi."</p>

<p>Mickey called a car&mdash;they got Evelyn in, with
much trouble, and finally arrived at the Hussman.</p>

<p>"My God, Pearl, what will they think&mdash;you
dragging her through the lobby looking the way
she does," as they were pulling Evelyn out of the
car, with the help of the driver.</p>

<p>"I don't know, but I hope they let one crack
out of them&mdash;that will give me all the excuse I'll
need to wreck this joint without stalling."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, girls," said the driver. "I'll
take her up like this," as he threw Evelyn over
his shoulder and started into the lobby.</p>

<p>"I'll get her up there and put her to bed."</p>

<p>"Don't you think, Pearl, that if you could get
some hot coffee down her it might make her come
out of it?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
"I don't know, but I'll try it&mdash;" as she said to
the bell-boy, "Bring me some hot coffee up here,
quick."</p>

<p>"Are you going over to the States after we get
Ev to bed, Pearl? You know you've a date over
there with Harry."</p>

<p>"Have I? I've been doing some heavy drinking
myself&mdash;I don't even remember it. Sure, we'll go
over there as soon as we give her some coffee."</p>

<p>"Let's take her into the bathroom, and strip
her in there, and then put her to bed," said Pearl,
as she opened the door for them to enter.</p>

<p>They took Evelyn in to the bathroom, the driver
holding her up while Pearl and Mickey stripped
her, clean to the skin; then the bellboy arrived
with the coffee.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute&mdash;I'll get a night-gown for her,
and then we will put her in bed, and pour some
of this hot stuff down her gullet. O.&nbsp;K., driver,
bring her in."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
He picked her up, and bringing her into the
room, laid her down, holding her head up, as he
took the cup out of Pearl's hand, and holding it to
Evelyn's lips, while the hot liquid brought moans
and groans from Evelyn&mdash;Pearl and Mickey stood
by to help.</p>

<p>"Now, let's cover her up, and leave her alone
to sleep&mdash;she will be all right when we get back
from the cafe."</p>

<p>Pearl turned the lights out, and down they
went, leaving Ev behind for the first time since
they had met.</p>

<p>"Jees," said Pearl, "I feel lost without her&mdash;she
is sure some regular scout." As they got into the
car that had brought them from the bridge&mdash;"To
the States, driver."</p>

<p>When they arrived at the States Cafe, the
height of the hilarity for the evening had passed,
for the less noisy crowd had settled down to black
coffee and food, to try and kill off some of the
liquor.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
Harry was sitting in a booth all alone, near the
door, eating a sandwich, as they came in. He did
not notice them until Pearl walked over to his
table.</p>

<p>"Hello, darling," as she sat down.</p>

<p>"Ah, gee, I'm glad you came&mdash;I've been waiting
a long time. I'd begun to think you were
going to stand me up," smiled Harry, with gladness
beaming from his face.</p>

<p>"Pearl, you and Harry excuse me&mdash;I'll see you
later," said Mickey, as she went towards the rear
of the place to join a crowd of people she seemed
to know.</p>

<p>"I haven't had much chance to talk to you
about last night, when that awful thing happened.
Evelyn and Mickey rushed right out over me, and
I didn't know what had become of you, Harry.
Did you get over the river all right?"</p>

<p>"No, I stayed on that side, at Dan's Hotel&mdash;they
know me. You see, lots of nights when I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
don't make the bridge, I stay over there. It's not
bad, really, but last night was a little unusual.
When I couldn't find you, I had a hunch that
Evelyn had gotten you clear of the place, and
when I heard that some women had waded the
river I knew that you were safe, because that's
one of Evelyn's pet tricks. No matter if the bridge
is open or closed, and Evelyn thinks that she had
better get across that border, she goes for the
river, and she has always been lucky&mdash;they have
never been able to catch her. Boy, Oh boy&mdash;what
a woman," laughed Harry.</p>

<p>"Oh, Harry, you should see my new apartment&mdash;it's
just grand."</p>

<p>"You said you have moved tonight&mdash;but I don't
think you told me where."</p>

<p>"To the Hussman."</p>

<p>"Oh, baby&mdash;putting on the Ritz."</p>

<p>"Of course not&mdash;I just had a streak of luck,
but you haven't even noticed my black eye."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
"Yes, sweetheart, I had noticed it, but I didn't
want to say anything&mdash;I know if it is any of my
business you will tell me, and it's not polite for a
man to ask personal questions of&mdash;well&mdash;of a girl
he really is crazy about."</p>

<p>"Harry, you are sweet, but you see the black
eye is the cause of my good luck. First, jealousy
caused the black eye, then the apartment was
rented to make up for it&mdash;see&mdash;that's all very
simple."</p>

<p>"Well, I can realize that anyone could be
jealous of you, but I can't imagine anyone being
mean enough to give you a shiner like that&mdash;I'm
terribly jealous of you, but I couldn't do that to
you&mdash;let's get out of here&mdash;this is no place to talk&mdash;can't
we go somewhere, just you and I?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my apartment&mdash;just you and I&mdash;Evelyn
has passed out."</p>

<p>They arose from the booth&mdash;this once Harry
took time to pay before they left. They strolled
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
leisurely up the street to the hotel, which is only
a few blocks away.</p>

<p>Pearl opened the door to the apartment, and
Harry went in, his eyes wide in amazement at the
loveliness of the place.</p>

<p>Evelyn, in the meantime, had aroused from her
drunken stupor and had ordered some food, and
was sitting on the divan eating it, when they came
in.</p>

<p>"I thought you two would be here sooner or
later. I sure have been on a good one tonight,"
said Evelyn, as they came in.</p>

<p>"Oh, Ev&mdash;I'm glad you came out of it&mdash;how
do you feel?" asked Pearl, as she went over and
felt of Evelyn's head. "Gee I'm glad you are
eating something. What was the matter tonight
that you passed out?"</p>

<p>"You don't mean to tell me that you passed
out tonight, Ev?" said Harry, as he came over
and stood in front of her.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
"Well, it's the first time in years, and I can't
imagine what caused it. I don't remember much
of anything."</p>

<p>"Here, Harry, sit down by me and tell me what
you think of my new home. Don't you think it
is lovely?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, its fine, but I don't get the connection
of the black eye and the apartment."</p>

<p>"It's just as well," said Evelyn. "The less you
get, the better off you will both be."</p>

<p>"No kidding, Pearl&mdash;what is the gag&mdash;who
is the sucker?"</p>

<p>"Oh, just a guy that thinks he is crazy about
me, that's all."</p>

<p>"Now, Harry, I want to ask you something
seriously," said Evelyn. "Maybe I'm wrong, maybe
I'm not, but you might as well know&mdash;you will
sooner or later&mdash;I been telling Pearl she is nuts,
now let's see what you think."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
"Let's hear it," answered Harry.</p>

<p>"Do you mind, Pearl?" asked Evelyn.</p>

<p>"No, I don't mind."</p>

<p>"Well, here's the story. You know that big
guy they call Big Boy? You and he have been
more less rivals for some time, and I know you are
very good friends. You know the guy pretty
well&mdash;you have seen him go on a rampage and
wreck a place, then pay for it. Well&mdash;he's nuts
for Pearl, and he is the one who gave her the
black eye because she lied to him about last night,
then he gave her a thousand bucks, and this apartment,
and anything else she wants&mdash;now, what
I'm coming to&mdash;this guy wants to marry her&mdash;I
know that will floor you&mdash;and he means it.
Pearl is taking all he can give her. Don't you
think that if he is crazy about her, that if he
catches her two-timing him he will go on such a
rampage he might kill her?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's right, Ev, that guy is a bad hombre&mdash;but
why should he catch her?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
"I give you credit for some sense, Harry. If
he gave her a black eye for lying, what will he do
to her when he finds out you or some other guy
is playing around his duck's nest?"</p>

<p>"Don't worry, Ev. Pearl's too clever for that&mdash;anytime
I fall for a woman I know she is clever,"
laughed Harry assuredly.</p>

<p>"That may be all well and good, but I'm
damned if I care to be around when the thing
happens," said Evelyn, as she guzzled some more
coffee.</p>

<p>"You didn't tell me what they did to Negro
Noche about that shooting last night, and what
did they do with Irene's body?" asked Pearl.</p>

<p>"Negro Noche wasn't even arrested&mdash;the
authorities said that she was protecting her home,
and that if another woman was trying to steal
her man, and she found them in each other's arms,
she had done the right thing, so she was let free.
About Irene, nobody seems to know where her
home is, or if she has any people. They are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
holding her body over in the morgue until they
can find out something, and if they don't they will
bury her out here in the usual pauper's grave."</p>

<p>"Oh, Jees that's awful," said Evelyn. "Well,
they won't bury her in no pauper's grave as long
as I got a cent."</p>

<p>"You are right," answered Pearl, "But Ev, I've
more money than you have&mdash;I'll pay for the
funeral, poor kid&mdash;that's usually the end of most
of us&mdash;God, that's awful&mdash;I'll tell you what we
will do&mdash;we'll get up early in the morning and
go over to the morgue, and arrange for her to
have a decent funeral."</p>

<p>"I haven't any money," said Harry. "But I'll
do anything I can."</p>

<p>"That's all right, Harry&mdash;I'm glad that I have
the money to do it&mdash;shall we bury her on the
Mex side, or shall we bring her over here?"</p>

<p>"What's the difference? I'm sure it wouldn't
make any difference to her, and then you might
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
have to go through some red tape about bringing
the body across the border," said Evelyn.</p>

<p>"Well, I better be getting home," said Harry,
as he arose to go.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Harry&mdash;stay up here tonight, won't
you?"</p>

<p>"Do you really want me to?"</p>

<p>"Oh, darling, you know I want you to."</p>

<p>"If you two must have your fun, then listen to
me&mdash;I'll stay in the other bedroom, and if anything
should happen that Big Boy would come in
any time, Harry, you come and get in bed with
me, then he couldn't say anything," explained
Evelyn.</p>

<p>"Ev, you're some little thinker&mdash;what would
we do without you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nuts," exclaimed Evelyn. "I'm going to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
bed&mdash;good-night," as she arose and went into
the bedroom.</p>

<p>Harry and Pearl sat for a long time on the
divan, holding each other's hands, not saying a
word. This was the third night they had known
each other, and events since that time had been
rather swift.</p>

<p>"I've seen lots of girls come down here, and
stay around for a while, then maybe make a good
marriage, then others go to the dogs, but of all
the lot you are the first one that I've ever really
been in love with," said Harry, softly.</p>

<p>"I love you, too, Harry, and it's my first real
love, but I don't quite know how you can love
me when you know what I'm doing and what I
am&mdash;don't that make a difference?"</p>

<p>"It might to some people, but not to me&mdash;but
you see I couldn't give you what Big Boy can."</p>

<p>"You mean you can't give me the money he can?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
"That's it&mdash;he can give you everything you
could ever want&mdash;money, clothes, cars&mdash;or just
anything you happen to want&mdash;why, look, he has
already given you a thousand dollars&mdash;I doubt
if I'll ever have a thousand in my whole life&mdash;I'm
just a bum singer."</p>

<p>"But just the same I love you, Harry&mdash;why
couldn't we do this&mdash;I've an idea&mdash;let me string
this guy along and get a load of dough, and then
we can beat it and start fresh some place where
no one knows us&mdash;would you like that?"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know about that&mdash;I'll have to
think it over&mdash;that is a little too much to say yes
to on so short a notice, and not a nice thing to do."</p>

<p>"What's the difference? What I'm doing already
is not exactly what the general run of
people would call decent."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's nothing&mdash;I know women about this
town that have good husbands and friends, and
they step out on the side for the dough, to buy
something they want, but they were respectable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
girls before they married, but this much I know&mdash;if
I marry a girl like you, I can depend on you
being on the level with me&mdash;I've seen enough of
life down here to know that."</p>

<p>"Suppose we talk this over some time tomorrow
or later. We should get some sleep tonight,"
said Pearl, as she laid her head on his shoulder.</p>

<p>Harry pulled her close to him, all was quiet in
the hotel, and the streets were quiet. The rest of
the night was bathed in liquid silver of a belated
moon, but inside each of them there raged a tornado
of love, desire, passion, that was soon to be
quelled by complete possession of each other, then
a sweet sleep of quiet and peace, that equaled
the quietness of the silent city outside.</p>

<p>Morning quietly slipped through the windows,
the bright hot sun rose, dispelling the chill of the
night. The city rose with all its noise and bustle,
as a sleeping dog rises and shakes itself, to be about
its busy routine of the day.</p>

<p>Evelyn awoke, looked around, then realized that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
she was at Pearl's apartment, then looked next to
her in bed, and was surprised that she was in bed
alone. She slowly climbed out of bed, going to
the window, looked out on the lovely morning,
then thinking of Irene, she started for the bedroom
where Pearl was lying in Harry's arms,
sleeping quietly.</p>

<p>"Hey, you two," as she shook them. "Come on&mdash;come
on&mdash;snap out of it&mdash;we have lots to do
today," as Pearl and Harry opened their eyes to
behold a sight which caused them to laugh loudly.
Evelyn standing in teddies, with her hair standing
on end, eyes bloodshot from the night before.</p>

<p>"Ev, have you looked at yourself in the mirror
yet?" asked Pearl.</p>

<p>"No, I haven't&mdash;I'm afraid to&mdash;I've heard
people sometimes die of fright&mdash;so I'm just working
up the courage to do that little thing&mdash;do you
want me to order breakfast?"</p>

<p>"Breakfast&mdash;that sounds good," said Harry, as
he sat up in bed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
"Ev, you're a darling&mdash;order a big one for me&mdash;I
need it&mdash;I'm starved&mdash;then we will go over
the river," as she went to the bathroom.</p>

<p>Evelyn called the morgue, and found that no
one seemed able to find Irene's people, or to find
out anything about her, so she told the undertakers
to get Irene ready and make all the arrangements
for the funeral to be held at two o'clock that
afternoon, at the Mexican Cemetery on the outskirts
of Juarez, then she spent the next half hour
calling every Hooker that she knew, and told them
the time of the funeral, and asked them to be
there, and to bring any of the other girls they
could get hold of.</p>

<p>"How many have you called, in all, Ev?" asked
Pearl, as Evelyn sat down beside her. "I'll call
and have these dishes taken away."</p>

<p>"About twenty in all, but they all know others
that I don't know and they will tell them."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm going to run out home," said Harry,
getting ready to leave, "I'll see you at the funeral."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
"All right, dear," said Pearl, as she kissed him goodbye.</p>

<p>"Don't you think we better go over and see if
there is anything we might do? I'll get a check
cashed and take enough money over to pay the
expenses for the flowers, since you insist on paying
all the funeral expenses&mdash;the least I can do
will be to see that she has lovely flowers, poor
kid."</p>

<p>"That's right, Ev, we had better go on over&mdash;I'll
have to get a check cashed, too."</p>

<p>They called a taxi and started for Juarez, and
as the car pulled over the bridge, and under the
shed where all cars stop to be questioned by the
Mexican officials before entering Juarez, there
were soldiers everywhere.</p>

<p>"Why are you Senoritas going to Juarez at
this time," asked one of the officials.</p>

<p>"We are going over to attend the funeral of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
the American girl who was shot Saturday night
in the Rio Bravo Hotel," answered Pearl.</p>

<p>"What other business have you to attend to
over there?"</p>

<p>"None."</p>

<p>"You will pardon, Senorita, but may I suggest
that as soon as possible you will return to the
American side&mdash;the rebels have left Chihuahua
City by train, and they may arrive at any time
from one o'clock to six."</p>

<p>"Thanks, we will," answered Pearl, as the official
motioned to the driver to drive on.</p>

<p>"I bet there will be some wild carrying on here
with the rebels, when they do arrive," laughed
Evelyn.</p>

<p>"I wonder if there will be much fighting?"</p>

<p>"Sure, there will be fighting, and lots of screaming
and running. The way they carry on you
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
think there is twice as much fighting as there
really is."</p>

<p>"I guess we had better try and get back before
the rebels arrive. What do you think, Ev?"</p>

<p>"Well, after the funeral we will come back.
We won't waste any time."</p>

<p>"Come right in, Senoritas," said the Mexican
undertaker, as he bowed low to them.</p>

<p>"You have made the necessary arrangements
that we called you about this morning?"</p>

<p>"Si, Senorita."</p>

<p>"How much is the whole bill?" asked Pearl, as
she fished into her bag.</p>

<p>"Four hundred Pesos, Senorita."</p>

<p>"How much American?"</p>

<p>"That will be two hundred dollars, Senorita,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
and that is everything. I have already had the
grave dug, and the time you said over the
phone is the time the funeral will take place. I,
Senorita, have taken the privilege of calling a
Padre&mdash;was that right?"</p>

<p>"That's O.&nbsp;K. by me, don't you think, Ev?"</p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<p>"Here's your money," as she handed him two
hundred dollars.</p>

<p>"The good God will be kind to you, Senorita,
for this good deed," as Pearl and Evelyn went out.</p>

<p>"Hell, I need a drink, don't you, Ev?"</p>

<p>"Yeah&mdash;a good stiff one," as they climbed in
the car.</p>

<p>"Driver, take us to the Central, and come in
and have a shot with us."</p>

<p>"Oke, Sister," answered the driver.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
They turned on the Sixteenth of September
Street, and had to stop to let troops pass, some
short, some tall, but none with uniforms that fit,
except the officers, who were perfectly groomed,
with beautiful uniforms that would have done
credit to a rear Admiral of anybody's country, and
as they marched past, sullen dirty faces showed
no sign of expression, of joy, of madness, chagrin,
nor contempt&mdash;they were like so many dirty
brown masks, that hide so much thievery, murder,
and cowardice underneath.</p>

<p>"Do the rebels look anything like this?" asked
Pearl, as they passed.</p>

<p>"Just the same&mdash;clothes may be different, but
that means nothing. These men that just
marched past may be on the rebel side before
sundown&mdash;they are just as willing to fight for
one side as the other, as long as it promises to
be profitable."</p>

<p>"I can't understand why they are always having
these revolutions down here."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
"Pearl, in our country every boy is taught
that he can, by hard study and work, be the
President if he wants to be, but down here every
boy is taught that he must be President, even if
he has to kill the former one, and they have tried
to live up to their teaching, so it's just another
case of some bad boy taking what he thinks is
rightfully his."</p>

<p>"I suppose they will stop the trains out of
town, and march in."</p>

<p>"Oh no they won't&mdash;they will ride those trains
into the heart of the town, screaming and yelling
and shooting at anybody that happens to be in
sight, at least that is the way they always have
done, and Mex's never change."</p>

<p>"I hope the rebels don't arrive before the
funeral is over&mdash;that would be awful."</p>

<p>"I'll say it would," as the car stopped. "Come
on, here's where we drink&mdash;come on, driver."
They all went in.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
"I'll have whiskey," said Pearl.</p>

<p>"So will I."</p>

<p>"Make it three whiskeys," answered the driver.
"Say do you girls want me to wait over here for
you?"</p>

<p>"No, we are going to stick around here until
time for the funeral. You can go on back&mdash;oh,
I almost forgot about paying you&mdash;here, take
this," as she shoved a bill in his hand.</p>

<p>"If I were you, girls, I wouldn't waste any
more time over here than I had to, and if you say
the word, I'll stay and see you through," answered
the driver.</p>

<p>"That's nice of you kid, but we will be O.&nbsp;K."</p>

<p>"So long," as he went.</p>

<p>"It's going to take more than one whiskey to
get me through that funeral," said Pearl.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
"Let's buy a couple of quarts, and go on out
to the cemetery and wait there," suggested Evelyn.</p>

<p>"That's the best idea of all," said Pearl, "Let's
go."</p>

<p>They took the two quarts, and slowly walked
up the street. Small groups of people, talking
near doorways, gazed at them curiously as they
went. Most of the bars and places of business
were closed, and the windows boarded up, caused
by the expected battle, and knowing full well
that windows would be smashed if they were
not somehow protected. As two o'clock drew
near, the hearse with the remains of Irene, started
for the cemetery, the driver looking like a cornered
rat, and mad at having to go out into the open
when the rebels might arrive at any time, drove
slowly, but fearfully, through the streets, toward
the cemetery.</p>

<p>Pearl and Evelyn were sitting on a fallen headstone,
drinking and discussing the injustice of life,
to them in particular, and to all in general. They
had just killed the first quart when the first bunch
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
of girls, headed by Mickey, came into the cemetery&mdash;some
were dressed as though they were going
to a party, others in street suits, but none in
mourning, as mourning could only be used once in
a great while, so why buy mourning for the one
funeral, and be stuck with something you couldn't
wear to hustle in.</p>

<p>"My goodness," said Mickey. "How long have
you been waiting here?"</p>

<p>"Oh, not very long&mdash;want a drink?" asked
Evelyn.</p>

<p>"Yeah&mdash;we brought several pints along with
us&mdash;there comes some more of the girls," as she
pointed along the road to about fifteen girls, all
in gay colors, coming along as if they were going
to a picnic.</p>

<p>"This is one of them things I sure don't like
to go through with it," said one of the girls.</p>

<p>"Me either," answered another.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
"Well, it's near two o'clock&mdash;it won't be long
now," remarked still another.</p>

<p>"I think that's the hearse coming now," said
Pearl, as she shaded her eyes with her hand, looking
down the road.</p>

<p>"We tried to get a taxi to bring us over, but not
one of them would come," said one of the newly
arrived girls.</p>

<p>"Well, you know there has been some talk
about a revolution going to take place over here,"
said one of the other girls.</p>

<p>"So I'd heard," remarked the former, in a cutting
voice.</p>

<p>"Yeah&mdash;that is the hearse all right&mdash;there is
someone with the driver&mdash;it must be the Padre,"
said Pearl, still watching.</p>

<p>The hearse drew up at the entrance, slowed
down, then proceeded to a far corner of the
cemetery, where the freshly dug grave yawned as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
though waiting for its toll, while the two Mexican
grave-diggers lay sleeping beside the fresh
pile of earth.</p>

<p>The girls moved slowly over to where the hearse
had stopped, as the driver got out and kicked the
grave-diggers awake, telling them in Spanish to
help earn their money by helping to get the
Gringo's body to the grave, which they did unwillingly.
The driver, the Padre, and the two
grave-diggers brought the box with the coffin inside
it, to the side of the grave, sat it down, while
the Padre began saying the service in Spanish and
in Latin.</p>

<p>Painted faces looked on, as tears began to streak
their cheeks, each thinking that this might have
been her; some probably wishing it was them,
knowing that at least their earthly troubles would
be over, no matter what would be in store for
them; other's minds went back to their pasts,
the others to their childhood. Soon there could
be heard sounds of soft weeping&mdash;the service was
over, the four men slowly let the coffin into the
grave, jerking the straps from under the box.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
The two grave-diggers began to shovel dirt into
the hole.</p>

<p>"Can any of you sluts say a prayer?" asked
Mickey.</p>

<p>"I ain't never prayed in my life," said one of
the girls, "But I'll try it," as they all bowed their
heads, as hard lumps of dirt and rock fell with a
hollow sound on the box.</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord, I ain't never asked you a single
favor in my life," began the girl slowly, "But Irene
is a good scout, and if she ever comes into your
place of business, don't turn her down&mdash;she
always paid for her drinks, poor kid&mdash;Amen."</p>

<p>"Come on, kids, let's get going from here,"
said Evelyn, as she wiped her eyes.</p>

<p>They all walked slowly to the gates of the
cemetery&mdash;those in front waited for the rest to
catch up.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
"Let's all have a drink," suggested Evelyn, as
she began to open the quart she still had.</p>

<p>They all gathered around, passing the bottle,
talking in low tones, starting to repair the damage
done to their make-ups by the tears.</p>

<p>"We had better be getting back to town," remarked
Pearl, and they all started down the road,
towards town, walking in little groups.</p>

<p>"Just think&mdash;that might have been any one of
us," said Mickey, "It wouldn't have mattered who
was with Juan Moros when Negro Noche came
in&mdash;she would have shot anyone she found with
him."</p>

<p>"Yeah&mdash;you're right, Mickey&mdash;it might have
been any one of us. Juan was a nice fellow to
everyone, but Noche is a bad bitch&mdash;don't let
anybody fool you about that, but she won't get
away with this&mdash;his people will see to that,"
answered Evelyn.</p>

<p>Pearl, Evelyn and Mickey were the first to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
arrive on the Sixteenth of September Street&mdash;the
rest of the girls had split into the usual groups
that they usually ran in, and came straggling along
behind.</p>

<p>"Let's go on down to the Central, and have a
few drinks and rest awhile, and let this wear off,"
suggested Evelyn.</p>

<p>"O.&nbsp;K." said Mickey, as they were nearing the
railroad tracks.</p>

<p>"Jees&mdash;look coming," said Pearl, pointing down
the tracks.</p>

<p>In the distance a train was coming&mdash;Mexicans
were hanging all over the engine, and on the roofs
of the box-cars, the whistle was blowing, guns
were firing. "It's the rebels."</p>

<p>"Here, we better get off the street&mdash;quick, let's
run in the Rio Bravo," said Evelyn, as she grabbed
Pearl's hand and started for the hotel.</p>

<p>The few people that had been standing in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
street, ran for shelter. Four of the Federal Cavalry
who had no chance to be disloyal, decided to
make a display of their bravery by wrecking the
rebel train, by riding four abreast into the locomotive,
therefore making history, for Mexico, as well
as being heroes themselves, but never considering
that they would not be present to hear of it, they
spurred their poor, bony horses on to the tracks,
one in command gave the order "Forward"&mdash;and
down the tracks they rode, the engine meeting
them at the crossing of the Sixteenth of September
Street.</p>

<p>Men, horses, legs, arms, heads, blood, manure,
and guns were scattered and strewn for blocks,
the engine whistling, bell ringing, men screaming,
groaning, dying, the Federal troops running to
meet the rebels, the engine derailed in the middle
of the street, the hissing of escaping steam, rebels
pouring out of box-cars, running into the fight,
screaming "Vive, La Mexico."</p>

<p>Both sides began to run behind buildings, firing
from behind, at anyone they saw, whether it be
friend or enemy.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
"We have to make that river somehow," said Evelyn.</p>

<p>"My God&mdash;what do you think has happened to
the other girls?" asked Pearl.</p>

<p>"They are probably in as bad a fix as we are,"
answered Mickey, as a stray bullet shattered the
windows of the lobby.</p>

<p>The rebels began to drive the Federals towards
the river, amidst much shouting and shooting and
excess bravado.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what we will do," said Evelyn.
"As the shooting moves toward the river, we will
try to get out of here&mdash;I'll take my drawers off
and put them on a pole like a flag of truce, and we
will try and make it."</p>

<p>"My God, what is that awful odor?" asked
Pearl.</p>

<p>"That's horse manure, mixed with blood, that
splattered on the side of this building when the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
train hit those horses," explained Evelyn, as she
was pulling off her underthings, putting them on
the end of a yard stick she had found behind the
deserted desk.</p>

<p>"Will we run for it, or how shall we try it?"
asked Mickey.</p>

<p>"We'll ease out into the street, holding this
flag up, then we will go up the middle of this street
to the corner, and down that way to the bridge,"
said Evelyn.</p>

<p>"Do you think they will shoot at us?" asked
Pearl.</p>

<p>"Possibly, but I'm willing to bet that the only
ones that have been killed in the fighting are the
ones there in the street, that were killed by the
train."</p>

<p>"You're right, there," said Mickey, as they
moved toward the door.</p>

<p>"Oh, God, what a horrible sight," said Pearl
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
as she shivered and put her hand over her eyes.</p>

<p>"Get hold of her, Mickey, she never saw anything
like this before. I guess it is kind of a shock
to her to see all these Cholos laying around here
in pieces," exclaimed Evelyn, as she stepped over
what had once been a man, but was now only
mangled flesh.</p>

<p>"If you don't want to look, you just keep your
hand over your eyes, dear, and I'll keep hold of
you until we get by this," said Mickey, softly,
as she put her arm around Pearl, and helped her
along.</p>

<p>"Come on here," called Evelyn.</p>

<p>They moved past the crossing, then into the
center of the street&mdash;bullets whizzed overhead
while toward the river there was a hot battle
raging.</p>

<p>On the American side the banks of the river
were lined with people watching the fighting, as
though it were a baseball game, oblivious of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
bullets that fell all around them. As the fighting
came nearer the river, two huge armored cars,
with French 75's mounted, rolled near the International
Bridge, muzzles lowering menacingly,
toward Mexico.</p>

<p>A scream came from down to the left of the
bridge, as a mother grabbed up her little one in
her arms, running toward the street. The child
had been killed by a stray bullet.</p>

<p>Phones began to buzz at Fort Bliss, saying that
the bullets from the fighting were falling thick and
fast on the American side, and that one had
already found its mark.</p>

<p>Five minutes passed&mdash;soon the screaming of a
siren could be heard, coming toward the bridge
was the large dark brown car with the American
flag flying from the front, and it drew up at the
foot of the bridge.</p>

<p>General M&mdash;&mdash; stepped from the car, face red
with fury.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
"Fire a warning from one of those 75's," commanded
the General, as he walked toward the
center of the bridge, as the voice of the 75 roared
across the border.</p>

<p>Firing on the Mexican side stopped immediately,
as one of the Federals came running toward
the gates on the bridge.</p>

<p>"Open these gates," commanded the General,
and the aides ran to do his bidding.</p>

<p>"What is it, Senor?" said the Federal, as he
came near the General.</p>

<p>"I want the Commander of the Rebels and the
Commander of the Federals at the foot of this
bridge in five minutes&mdash;be on your way."</p>

<p>The Federal ran back to the group of soldiers,
they all began to talk excitedly, running in several
directions.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
Truck loads of soldiers from Fort Bliss were
unloading, all ready for action.</p>

<p>General M&mdash;&mdash; stood, legs spread, looking at
his watch, tapping his riding boot with his stick,
as the Federal Commander came to where he was
standing.</p>

<p>"You have sent for me, Senor&mdash;I have come,"
as the sound of a horse galloping down the street
was heard.</p>

<p>"At your command, I have come, Senor," said
the rebel General, as he swaggered up to the General,
looking at the Federal as though he were the
lowest thing on earth.</p>

<p>"Yes, I sent for you both," said General
M&mdash;&mdash;, "I want to tell you that if you saddle-faced
bastards let another bullet fall on the American
side of the river, I'll wipe the whole goddamn
lot of you, and this town, off the map," as he
turned, giving an order to close the gates again,
as the armored cars once more came into position.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
The General of the Rebels rode away, to his
own troops, who in the lull of the fighting had
moved up on the Federals.</p>

<p>The fighting began again, with renewed vigor
on the side of the rebels, who had drawn their
bayonets, while the Federals ran for the river,
wading in and making for the American side,
wasting no time in doing it.</p>

<p>Evelyn, Pearl and Mickey were coming down
the middle of Lysol Lane, Evelyn still holding the
drawers on the stick, showing she was a non-combatant,
when she spied about fifty girls huddled
on one side of a bar, some peeping around the
corner. There were all the girls who had been
to the funeral, and others, who had been to Juarez
on their usual business, and all together, wondering
how they were going to get to the American
side.</p>

<p>"Hey, Gang," called Evelyn, "What do you
say if we all make a run for the river&mdash;once
we are in the river, we will be safe."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
"How will we do it?" asked the girls.</p>

<p>"Here's the way," explained Evelyn. "We all
get in the street, and start to run&mdash;the rebels have
their backs this way&mdash;they won't see us until we
are almost in the river&mdash;because from what I can
see they have already driven the Federals into the
river and are already throwing rocks at them.
Well, we run as quietly as possible and burst
right through the rebels, and into the river&mdash;take
the right side of the bridge, it's better&mdash;now, do
you all understand?"</p>

<p>The girls nodded that they did.</p>

<p>"All right, then let's get going," as they all
started down the street at a trot. They neared
the river very quietly then amidst screams and
yells they burst through the rebels, leaping into
the river like rats from a sinking ship, grabbing
at each other, helping each other through the
quick-sand, and cold water, some holding on to
their bottles of whiskey that they had brought
along to give them courage. The few Federals
who had not reached the American side, turned
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
back to help the girls, amidst laughing, screaming,
cursing, and splashing of water.</p>

<p>The American soldiers were rounding the
Federal troops up the way a Texas cowboy rounds
up cattle, herding them into one bunch, while
the girls pulled themselves out of the river without
the aid of anyone except themselves. When
they were out of the river, they went in a body
to the street where the General and his aides were.</p>

<p>"This is a hell of a note," said Evelyn. "A
bunch of good American women should have to
wade that damn river, and no one to even help
them up the bank&mdash;you don't seem to realize that
once in a while a lady needs a little help."</p>

<p>"You had no business on that side," said the
General, curtly. "You knew there was to be a
battle&mdash;the papers carried the news, and all
Americans were warned to stay away from there,"
he continued.</p>

<p>"Well, just the same, it's a hell of a way to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
treat ladies," answered Evelyn, as she sat down
on the curb of the sidewalk.</p>

<p>"Senoritas&mdash;Senoritas," came the voice of the
Rebel General, who had climbed up on the side
of the bridge.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with that guy?" said
Mickey, as she moved toward the foot of the
bridge to hear what he had to say.</p>

<p>"Senoritas&mdash;can you hear me?" he called across
the river.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute&mdash;all right, spill it," called
Evelyn.</p>

<p>"Senoritas&mdash;we do not fight with women&mdash;you
are perfectly safe."</p>

<p>"Hell's fire&mdash;we know that now&mdash;ain't we over
here?" answered Evelyn.</p>

<p>"A thousand pardons, Senoritas&mdash;but we want
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
you to come back and drink with the victorious&mdash;to
be our guests for the evening."</p>

<p>"Now, you see," explained Evelyn, "that's what
I call a gentleman, a real fellow," as she walked
over to the American General. "Say old top,
would you mind having them gates opened and let
us go back on the other side?"</p>

<p>"No, those gates remain closed until this
trouble is settled."</p>

<p>"O.&nbsp;K. brother," as she went back to the girls,
who were waving at the rebels. "Come on, gang,
we'll go back the way we came," and they started
off in the river, with much more enthusiasm than
the first time.</p>

<p>"Come back here," yelled one of the American
officers. "You can't cross that river."</p>

<p>"The Hell you say," called Evelyn, who was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
already in the water, leading the procession. "At
least, these guys will buy us a drink."</p>

<p>"Do you think it's safe to go over here now,"
Pearl asked Evelyn.</p>

<p>"Sure, and profitable&mdash;these guys will open
every safe in the town, and all the champagne you
can drink. I been through these things before,"
explained Evelyn, as the rebels were wading out
to help them.</p>

<p>"You see," said Mickey, "these guys will drink
so much they will just pass out all over the place,
and you can go through their pockets right and
left, in perfect safety, and how I'll go through
them is nobody's business."</p>

<p>"It's all new to me, but I'm with you,"
answered Pearl.</p>

<p>"Sure, honey, that's the way&mdash;get all you can&mdash;you
can't never have too much."</p>

<p>The rebels were throwing their hats in the air,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
shouting at their victory, with only one thought
in their minds&mdash;to do all the looting possible, and
drinking as well. They started with the nearest
bar, the girls in their midst, singing, laughing, and
looking forward to a hilarious time. They didn't
wait to open the bottles of champagne&mdash;they
broke the necks off and poured it over each other&mdash;they
were wet from the river, so why not be
wet with liquor.</p>

<p>The Federals of Mexico were taken to Fort Bliss
and quartered until they could be sent back to
Mexico&mdash;they weren't prisoners&mdash;they were more
refugees than anything else.</p>

<p>The rest of the day and night was spent in
drinking, dancing, singing and general hilarity.
Juarez was never more gay or wild&mdash;looting was
indulged in&mdash;in a big way; every safe was opened.
The rebels needed gold, and American money,
whether paper or silver, was gold to them&mdash;the
girls getting their share of the loot.</p>

<p>"I've stood about all of this I can," said Pearl,
as she tried to get up from the table.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
"Do you want to go home, honey?" asked Evelyn.</p>

<p>"Home or anywhere, but I've got to come out
of this&mdash;I've been drinking too much&mdash;I'll go nuts
if I don't get out of it for a while."</p>

<p>"O.&nbsp;K. dear, I'll take you home," said Evelyn,
staggering to her feet.</p>

<p>"Do you think you can manage it all right without
me?" asked Mickey.</p>

<p>"Sure&mdash;I can get Pearl home all right, but ain't
you had enough yet?"</p>

<p>"I've had plenty to drink, but I haven't got all
the money I can use yet."</p>

<p>"Well, how much have you got?" asked Evelyn.</p>

<p>"I don't know, but I've sure been going
through these lice. I've got as much as I dare put
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
in my stockings, and I got wads in my waist, and
some pinned in my step-ins."</p>

<p>"Well, we'll be seeing you,&mdash;come on, Pearl&mdash;give
me your arm&mdash;we'll make it some-how," as
they staggered toward the door.</p>

<p>"Do you think we will have to wade that
damned river again?" asked Pearl.</p>

<p>"I hope not&mdash;we'll go to the gates, and I'll
try and argue those guys to let a couple of ladies
through."</p>

<p>Once again the two staggered toward the International
Bridge. The streets were deserted, not
a person was to be seen, only a small group around
the foot of the bridge. Day was just beginning to
break over the horizon.</p>

<p>"Where are you Senoritas going?" asked one
of the Mexicans.</p>

<p>"Home," said Evelyn.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
"I'm veer sorry, Senorita, but the Americans
will not let you through the gates."</p>

<p>"Well, we will see about that," as they neared
the huge wire gates. "Hey&mdash;you&mdash;how's to let
a couple of ladies through&mdash;we want to get
home."</p>

<p>"Sorry, sister, we got orders to open these gates
to no one," came the answer.</p>

<p>"Well, you got a Hell of a nerve&mdash;we're
American citizens, and I demand that you let us
through."</p>

<p>"Sorry, sister&mdash;but orders is orders."</p>

<p>"Well, you louse, do you mean to tell us you
are going to make us wade that river again today?"</p>

<p>"If you want to get to the American side, you'll
have to wade it."</p>

<p>"That's our good Americans for you," said
Evelyn in disgust. "I'm damned if I know which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
is the worst, these Goddamn Mexicans or that
lousy American scum that tries to be so damn
important."</p>

<p>"Come on, Ev&mdash;we've waded it before&mdash;we
might as well do it again&mdash;at that the cold water
may wake us up."</p>

<p>They walked back to the Mexican foot of the
bridge, and over the levee, holding to each other
once more as they started again through the chill
waters of the Rio Grande.</p>

<p>"Halt&mdash;who goes there?" came the challenge
from the U.&nbsp;S. side, as they neared the bank.</p>

<p>"Who the Hell do you think?" asked Evelyn,
as they climbed out of the water.</p>

<p>"Say, woman&mdash;ain't you got any more sense
than to come across that river that way? We will
have to hold you now for investigation."</p>

<p>"Oh, yeah? Brother, that's just too bad&mdash;we
asked you to open those gates, and let us through,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
and you wouldn't do it, now if you want to really
start some trouble, just try and hold us for wading
across."</p>

<p>"Well, you will have to come up on the bridge,
and do some tall explaining."</p>

<p>"O.&nbsp;K. I'll do some explaining&mdash;you're damn
tooting," as they all three started for the foot of
the bridge, where the commanding officer was
waiting.</p>

<p>"These two women waded across the river,
sir," explained the soldier, as they walked up.</p>

<p>"Would you mind explaining," began the
officer, "what you two are doing at this hour of
the morning, wading across the International
border?"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;for Christ's sake&mdash;what's the big idea?"
asked Evelyn.</p>

<p>"Just this&mdash;you women think you can get away
with this stuff because you are women, and
possi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>bly
because you think it's smart. Well, you can't&mdash;you
will have to be detained, and taken in front
of the Commanding General."</p>

<p>"Well, you get a load of this&mdash;you low-born,
half-witted, self-inflated with your own importance,
shave-tail Bastard&mdash;you ain't detaining me
or my girl friend for no investigation&mdash;see&mdash;you,
or your men refused to open that gate to let two
American citizens through, and we had to wade
the river, and it's scum like you that has managed
to get into office in this country, and run it with
stuffed uniforms that wouldn't know the meaning
of the word MAN if it was drawn in blue-print
for them&mdash;you stand and tell me what you are
going to do&mdash;why, Goddamn you, when I get
through telling the General what I think, as well
as the American Consul, you'll be a buck private
again&mdash;you've got a gall&mdash;you impudent little
runt."</p>

<p>"Just the same, I'm sorry, but the General will
have to give his O.&nbsp;K. on your crossing."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
"Then, by God&mdash;you'll call him on the phone
right now," said Evelyn.</p>

<p>"It isn't customary to disturb the General at
this hour of the morning."</p>

<p>"That's too bad for the General, that he has to
be aroused out of his beauty sleep."</p>

<p>"I will call him, even though it is not the ordinary
routine."</p>

<p>"And how you will call him," exclaimed
Evelyn.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm not quite used to the ways of the
border yet, but it seems to me to be rather against
one to be an American down here," said Pearl.</p>

<p>"The fault ain't with America&mdash;it's with the
ignorant bastards that's allowed to run it,"
answered Evelyn, as the Lieutenant was calling
Fort Bliss.</p>

<p>After much delay the General was finally
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
reached. "What the Hell are you calling me for
at this time of the morning?" he roared over the
phone.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, sir, but it's about two women that
have just waded the river, and we have detained
them, and they have insisted that we call you, or
they will take it up with the American Consul.
I thought it best to call you."</p>

<p>Evelyn leaned her ear close to the receiver.</p>

<p>"Are they respectable women?" asked the
General.</p>

<p>"I'll answer that question," said Evelyn, as she
snatched the receiver from the Lieutenant. "What
the Hell difference does it make whether we are
considered respectable or not&mdash;we are American
citizens, that ought to be enough."</p>

<p>"Why were you wading the river at this hour
of the morning?" asked the General.</p>

<p>"Because we want to get home, and one of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
your lackeys refused to unlock the gates&mdash;that's
why we waded the river."</p>

<p>"Would you please let me talk to the gentleman
who called me, please," said the General, as he
boiled.</p>

<p>"Sure," as she turned to the Lieutenant. "He
wants to talk to you," as she handed him the
receiver with mock dignity.</p>

<p>"Get those women's addresses and names, and
let them go, and don't you call me again, as he
slammed the receiver up.</p>

<p>"Well, what did he tell you?" asked Evelyn,
with contempt.</p>

<p>"He asked me to get your names and addresses,
and let you go home."</p>

<p>"Ask Hell&mdash;he told you to, you mean&mdash;well,
my name is Evelyn and I haven't got a last name,
as far as you are concerned, and I live at the San
Antonio Apartments," said Evelyn.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
"My name is Pearl Jones, and I live at the Hussman."</p>

<p>"Hussman," repeated the Lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Yeah, Hussman&mdash;and no smart cracks&mdash;from
you, either&mdash;and don't get the idea that you can
use the addresses for your own convenience when
you have a day off."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry to have caused you ladies any
trouble," smiled the Lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Ah, nuts to you, brother," said Evelyn, as she
gave him a loud, juicy raspberry.</p>

<p>"Come on, Ev&mdash;let's call a taxi&mdash;I'm as near
all in as I'll ever be, and live to tell it. Come
on up to my joint and stay, will you? I don't
like to be alone."</p>

<p>"Jees, I might as well move to your place&mdash;I
don't seem to ever stay at home any more," said
Evelyn. "Here, we will call from the same phone
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
that big lousy Lieutenant just used," as she turned
back.</p>

<p>Loud rapping on the door aroused Pearl out of
the deep sleep she had been in since she had
climbed into bed that morning. "Who's there?"
she called, still half asleep.</p>

<p>"Mickey," came the voice outside.</p>

<p>"Just a minute, dear, I'll let you in," answered
Pearl, as she crawled out of bed and staggered to
the door.</p>

<p>"For the love of Heaven, don't you expect to
get up today?"</p>

<p>"What time is it?" asked Pearl, yawning.</p>

<p>"It's nearly five o'clock&mdash;have you been in bed
all day?"</p>

<p>"Uh-huh."</p>

<p>"What's become of Evelyn? I've been over to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
her apartment several times, and she hasn't been
there all day."</p>

<p>"She is here with me."</p>

<p>"Well, you two sure have been sleeping sound.
I been up here three times, and had the clerk ring
the room several times, but no answer."</p>

<p>"We were nearly dead when we got here this
morning. We had to wade that damn river again.
How did you get across?"</p>

<p>"They opened the gates when I went and asked
them to let me through."</p>

<p>"Well, the lousy tramps&mdash;and the way they
treated us this morning&mdash;they sure was nasty."</p>

<p>"I stayed as long as I thought it was safe for
me to stay, I finally got to go through the rebel
General's pockets, then I decided to come home
and get a little sleep. I feel fine now, and did I
make the dough last night? Seven hundred bucks,
not so bad."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
"I should say not. Come on and let's wake Ev
up. Have you got anything to drink with you?
I haven't got a thing up here."</p>

<p>"Yeah, I have a bottle with me. I sure know
what it is getting up after having been on a good
one, and not having a little drink to pick me up&mdash;it's
awful," as they went into the bedroom, where
Evelyn was still snoring.</p>

<p>"Hey, sister, snap out of it," yelled Mickey, as
she shook Evelyn real hard.</p>

<p>Evelyn turned over and opened her eyes.
"What's the big idea?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Look," said Mickey, as she held a pint of
whiskey where Evelyn could see it.</p>

<p>"Oh, great Heavens, give me a drink quick,
before I have time to start thinking," as she raised
up in bed, taking the bottle from Mickey.</p>

<p>"Save me a drink, Ev," said Pearl, as she started
to the bathroom.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
"Well, you better hurry back, you know when
Ev gets a bottle, she don't want to give it up until
it's empty," called Mickey.</p>

<p>"Did you make any money out of the revolution,
Mickey?" asked Evelyn.</p>

<p>"Sure, did you?"</p>

<p>"I don't know yet, I haven't been sober enough
to count it, but what I've got is on the chair
there," as she pointed to a chair, loaded with
clothes.</p>

<p>"I'll hand it to you and see just how much you
have made," said Mickey, as she handed the
clothes to Evelyn.</p>

<p>"How long do you think the border will be
closed, Ev?" asked Pearl.</p>

<p>"Well, that's hard to tell. Sometimes those
things last only a few days, then again they have
been known to last months, but if we can't go over
there, nobody else can, and I know all the
apart<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>ments
around here where there are likely to be
parties, so the only thing to do is make the rounds
of them, and chisel there, just like we did on the
other side."</p>

<p>"What about liquor?"</p>

<p>"Don't worry about that&mdash;there is more on this
side than there is on the other side," said Evelyn,
as she began to lay out her money.</p>

<p>"Did you make anything last night, Pearl?"
asked Mickey.</p>

<p>"I haven't looked yet."</p>

<p>"I've got the enormous sum of thirty-five
bucks," said Evelyn, as she looked disgustedly at
the crumpled money on the bed cover.</p>

<p>"Well, honey, you didn't stay over there as long
as I did, and you see I stayed until I got to go
through the General's pockets, and he is the bird
with most of the money. I had my eye on him
all night," said Mickey.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
"Now that another evening is here, what are
we going to do with it?" asked Pearl.</p>

<p>"I know&mdash;we'll call up some of the girls I know,
and see if we can't find some place to go, or maybe
we can engineer a party out at my place. If we
can, we will gather the fellows that we know to
get the whiskey, and make it a rip-roaring, bang-up
party&mdash;what do you say?"</p>

<p>"O.&nbsp;K. with me&mdash;how about you, Pearl?" asked
Evelyn.</p>

<p>"Whatever you all say is right with me."</p>

<p>"I've fallen for a new boy friend. I don't
know what his name is, but they call him Dusty,
and is he good looking, and can he fight? But&mdash;he's
another one of those that haven't got a dime,
but still, I sure can have a swell time with him.
I'll call him right now, and see if he can get the
rest of the boys," enthused Mickey.</p>

<p>"I've never heard you rave over a guy before,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
unless he had something you wanted," said
Evelyn.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;," said Mickey, slowly, "I guess he's
got something I want."</p>

<p>"Excuse me for living," said Evelyn, as she
climbed out of bed, gathering up the money that
she had been counting, "I don't know what he
has got, but whatever it is, he has as good as lost
it right now."</p>

<p>Mickey went to the phone, calling several
numbers before she finally got Dusty, who from
the trend of the conservation over the phone,
was glad to get the other fellows for the party,
much to the joy of Mickey.</p>

<p>Evening came, they usually do, even in El Paso,
and this evening was very little different from any
of the others. The party started at Mickey's wild,
mad, hilarious, drinking, loving, laughing, fighting
and all the more thrilling to all concerned, because
of its being on the American side. All
who were invited, came, and brought others that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
weren't invited, as well as their friends also, but
no one cared&mdash;it was for a good time that the
party was given and everybody proceeded to make
the most of the chance.</p>

<p>Twenty-four hours later the party was still
going strong. The hilarity had grown in volume,
instead of subsiding&mdash;the party was going too
strong to stay in the bounds of the house&mdash;people
were wanting to go places, and still keep the party
going.</p>

<p>"I got an idea," said Pearl.</p>

<p>"What is it, honey?" asked Evelyn.</p>

<p>"Why don't we go to my place, and still keep
the party going there, and after that we will go
to some place else&mdash;ain't that a good idea?"</p>

<p>"Sure, it's a good idea, but I can't tell how long
it will last at that hotel&mdash;they may be particular
about a party like this."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;," thought Pearl, as she continued, "we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
can go there and when we can't keep it up there
any longer, then we will go elsewhere&mdash;how's
that?"</p>

<p>"Fine, let's call Mickey, and tell her, and see
what she says."</p>

<p>"She is in the Kitchen, we will go in there and
tell her," as they shoved their way into the
kitchen, where new bottles were being opened.</p>

<p>"Sweetheart," said Harry, as Pearl came into
the kitchen, "I was just getting you another drink&mdash;here
it is," as he offered her the bottle.</p>

<p>"Harry, my sweet, I've a surprise for you&mdash;we
are all going to my hotel&mdash;that's what we
came in here to tell Mickey&mdash;are you for it,
Mickey?" asked Pearl.</p>

<p>"Sure, darling, I'll go any place&mdash;let's gather
up all the licker we have left here and get started,"
as she began to set all the bottles on the sink.</p>

<p>The news spread, and soon everybody was
sing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>ing
in a loud voice, "we're going to the Hussman&mdash;we're
going to the Hussman," amidst much
skipping and dancing.</p>

<p>"Shall I call Tony?" asked Evelyn.</p>

<p>"Sure," answered Pearl. "The sooner the better."</p>

<p>"You better call several cars for this mob,"
said Pearl.</p>

<p>"How many of them are there?" asked Evelyn,
as she picked up the phone.</p>

<p>"I don't know, but you better call about five
or six cars, maybe seven&mdash;there's some people out
in the yard, and it's too dark to see how many
there are."</p>

<p>"Hello, Tony&mdash;this is Ev&mdash;well, look&mdash;we want
you to send some transportation out to Mickey's
for the party that is moving to the Hussman&mdash;you
knew that there was a party going on, didn't
you? Well, I guess there wasn't anyone who
didn't&mdash;come right on out&mdash;O.&nbsp;K.&mdash;good-bye,"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
as she hung up. "They will be here right away."</p>

<p>The cars soon began to arrive, the drivers were
taken in and made to drink whether they wanted
to or not, and there were none who didn't want
to. Seven cars were little enough&mdash;people were
hanging all over the outsides of the cars, screaming
and singing, some fully dressed, others partially
dressed, others with only a street coat and
shoes on.</p>

<p>They arrived at the Hussman&mdash;the bellboys
were rushing around madly, expecting at least to
earn some tips, which they did by bringing ice,
and ginger ale to the room, the crowd unloaded
in front of the hotel, each one trying not to look
drunk and to be a lady or gentleman, until they
got through the lobby to the elevator&mdash;some were
helping others, others were staggering it alone.
Pearl and Evelyn and Mickey in the lead, with
Mickey loaded down with bottles, wrapped in a
sheet like it might be soiled laundry, elevators
started the mad procession of getting everyone
off on the right floor, which became more noisy
as the newness of the place began to wear off.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
Pearl threw everything wide open, told everybody
to make themselves at home, which they
were already doing&mdash;those who had gotten thirsty
on the ride were already in the kitchenette, uncorking
bottles. Evelyn sat at the phone, ordering
more liquor; Pearl and Harry, locked in each
other's arms, oblivious to all that was taking place.
Mickey eyeing one of the taxi drivers that the
crowd had brought with them, and wondering
how much he might have in his pockets, and proceeding
to make him drunk enough to find out.</p>

<p>The party grew&mdash;other guests who were on
the same floor, who were in the mood, joined in
the crowd. People were going from one room to
another, soon the phone in Pearl's apartment
began to ring&mdash;the management asked them to be
just a little more quiet, as they were annoying
guests five floors away. The crowd was quiet at
least three minutes, when it began all over again,
in all its flamboyancy&mdash;drinking began to get
heavier, some of the crowd began to pass out
wherever they happened to be&mdash;that's where they
lay.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
Noon the following day.</p>

<p>Big Boy approached the desk of the Hussman.
"Is Miss Jones in?"</p>

<p>"That would be rather hard to say, sir,"
answered the clerk, "but I'll try and find out."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?" asked Big Boy,
puzzled.</p>

<p>"Well, you see, sir&mdash;there has been a party
going on on that floor, and in her apartment,
since last night, and it's only been quiet for about
two hours now. There were a few who left,
I'll find out if Miss Jones is still up there," as
he asked the operator to ring Pearl's apartment,
which she did for several minutes, but got no
answer.</p>

<p>"I'll go up and see if she is there, and what
the Hell's going on," as he started for the elevator.</p>

<p>The apartment door was standing half open&mdash;two
of the maids were peeking in, and commenting
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
in low tones on what they saw, as Big Boy came
up, they moved away.</p>

<p>He pushed the door open, stood looking in at
the sight that greeted him&mdash;of bodies laying on
the floor, piled on the divan, on chairs, and on
each other. He started for Pearl's bedroom.</p>

<p>Pearl was laying in Harry's arms on the bed,
where they had both passed out hours before.
Evelyn was laying on the floor on one side, and
Mickey on the other. Mickey had passed out with
her hand in the taxi driver's pocket.</p>

<p>Big Boy quivered with rage&mdash;he grabbed Harry
and Pearl by the arms, and dragged them out of
bed, nothing on his mind except that Pearl had
lied to him again.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later the police began to arrive&mdash;screaming
a partly clad woman, running
through the lobby headed for the street, made the
more respectable guests' eyes bulge in amazement.</p>

<p>Pearl's apartment was a total loss. Big Boy
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
had completely wrecked it with Harry, who had
come out of his stupor long enough to put up a
savage fight, all the participants of the party that
could make a get-away had done so, except those
that were too drunk to realize that this might
mean a jail sentence. Evelyn had taken Pearl into
the bathroom, with the help of Mickey, and they
were trying to revive her.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid he's killed her, Mickey," said
Evelyn excitedly, as she patted cool water on
Pearl's head, and wiped the blood off her face.</p>

<p>"Oh, Jees, I hope not&mdash;let's keep working with
her&mdash;maybe we can bring her around&mdash;if somebody
don't stop him, he is sure to kill Harry."</p>

<p>"I wonder what that is?" asked Evelyn, as the
screams in the other room became louder, then
died down.</p>

<p>"Oh, God, he might have killed Harry. If he
has, we are all sure in for it."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
"Open that door, in the name of the Law,"
came a voice from the outside.</p>

<p>Evelyn rose to her feet, and unlocked the door,
swinging it wide open, as one of the plain clothes
men stepped in.</p>

<p>"What's the matter in here?"</p>

<p>"That louse has damn near killed this girl,&mdash;we
can't bring her to," said Evelyn.</p>

<p>"All right, we'll get her to the emergency
hospital quick," as he called two of the other
men to take charge of Pearl. "You two girls
better come with us."</p>

<p>"Where?" asked Mickey.</p>

<p>"Police station, sister&mdash;you've been there
before."</p>

<p>"Well, that's all right by us&mdash;we don't mind&mdash;we
ain't done nothing."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
The lobby was in a panic, the ambulance had
taken Harry and Pearl to the hospital, and the
patrol wagon was backed up to the door, partly
filled with screaming girls, and three officers had
over-powered Big Boy, and had him in another
car.</p>

<p>"You girls get in the wagon with the rest of
your sisters," said the officer who brought Mickey
and Evelyn down.</p>

<p>They arrived at the station, and were booked
with disturbing the peace, and disorderly conduct.</p>

<p>Big Boy was booked with disturbing the peace,
assault and battery with intent to kill.</p>

<p>"Can we get out on bail?" asked Evelyn.</p>

<p>"Sure," answered the desk sergeant. "Ten
bucks."</p>

<p>"I've got mine, have you enough Mickey for
yourself?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
"Yes, I have some dough," as she fished some
money out of her stocking.</p>

<p>They rushed over to the hospital, where they
were told that Pearl was resting easy, and there
was nothing serious but cuts and bruises, of which
there were many.</p>

<p>"Ah, gee, kid, I'm sorry," said Evelyn, as she
came to the bed where Pearl lay bandaged, "How
do you feel?"</p>

<p>"Awful, honey&mdash;how is Harry? They haven't
told me yet. Will you find out for me?"</p>

<p>"Sure, I'll find out for you. Mickey you stay
here until I come back."</p>

<p>"That guy's a dirty louse to beat you up this
way, but don't you worry, dear, you will be all
right. I wish I had a dollar for every time I've
been to the hospital for some guy finding out I
went through his pockets."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
"Oh, this is an awful mess. Mickey, what did
they do to you and Ev?"</p>

<p>"Took us to the station, and we got out on bail&mdash;ten
bucks apiece."</p>

<p>"Oh, here comes Ev."</p>

<p>"Well, honey, you needn't worry," said Evelyn,
as she sat down on the side of the bed, "Harry is
only beat up, but nothing serious, just cuts and
bruises and a couple of black eyes."</p>

<p>"Ev, dear, I want you to go over to the hotel,
and pack all my things and take them to your
place and keep them until I get out of here&mdash;will
you do that for me?"</p>

<p>"Sure, honey, and anything else you want me
to do."</p>

<p>"Miss Jones, pardon me," said the nurse, as
she came over to the bed, "there is a gentleman
to see you&mdash;he didn't give any name, just said
say Big Boy."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
"Don't let him in here, oh, please&mdash;don't let him
in here&mdash;I'm afraid of him," said Pearl, nearly
crying.</p>

<p>"I'll go and talk to him," said Evelyn, as she
rose from the bed, "I'll tell that yellow bastard
something."</p>

<p>Evelyn followed the nurse out to where Big
Boy was sitting.</p>

<p>"Well, how did you get out so soon?" asked
Evelyn.</p>

<p>"I'm out on bail&mdash;twenty-five hundred&mdash;I want
to see her&mdash;I'm crazy, but I've got to see her,"
said Big Boy nervously.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," said the nurse, "but you can't see
her," as she walked away.</p>

<p>"Why can't I see her, Evelyn?"</p>

<p>"Ain't you funny? You don't think she would
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
see you after the way you beat her up&mdash;you must
be nuts."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;Ev&mdash;I've got to see her."</p>

<p>"Well, this is one thing you won't be able to
explain away, or buy away. She is through with
you and you ought to know it. Why make her
suffer more by coming here to see her? You know
she is scared to death of you?"</p>

<p>"Ah, Ev&mdash;I can't live without her."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you will die young then&mdash;you think
that because you have money, you can beat up
who you please, and then give them a present and
that it is all over. Grow up&mdash;don't be like that&mdash;you
know she is only a kid, and new to this
racket, and then you pull something like that."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll tell you this much, and you can tell
her for me. If I can't have her, no other son-of-a-bitch
will get her. I'll kill her first&mdash;do you get
me?" his mouth trembling in rage.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
"Listen, you ain't scaring me, Big Boy&mdash;I
know your money will get you out of this scrape,
but you wouldn't pull anything like that. Your
money wouldn't get you out of that, and what's
more, you better lay off her&mdash;I'm telling you that
for myself."</p>

<p>"Ah, Ev, can't you see I'm nearly crazy for
having treated her like I did. Do you think you
can talk her into seeing me? Won't you try?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'll think about it&mdash;but don't come here
any more, you only scare her, and you won't get
to see her. I'll see you later," as she started to go
back to where Pearl was.</p>

<p>"What did he say, Ev?" asked Pearl, anxiously,
as Evelyn sat down.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing, honey&mdash;he wanted to see you.
He had calmed down and you won't have nothing
more to worry about, so you just rest and
get well."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you ladies will have to go now,"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
said the nurse, as she came to the foot of the bed.</p>

<p>"I'll be up later and see if I can do anything,"
said Evelyn, as she and Mickey rose to go.</p>

<p>"Come back as soon as they will let you," said
Pearl.</p>

<p>"All right, honey, we'll go and move your
things now, and then we will be back later. Now,
don't you worry, honey, you just rest&mdash;good-bye,"
as they left the room.</p>

<p>"What did he have to say, Ev?" as they
reached the street.</p>

<p>"Well, it ain't so much what he said, but it's
the way he said it. I'm afraid he might kill her
if he gets hold of her again. Of course, he is sorry
and all that now, but the next time he gets mad
at her, or catches her with somebody else, he will
kill her as sure as there is a Heaven. He said if he
couldn't have her, no one else could, and you
know him, Mickey, he means business."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
"You're right there, Ev, that guy means business.
Well, he can't get at her there in the hospital."</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid of him doing anything to her
there&mdash;he wants to make up with her now&mdash;it's
when he gets mad at her again that I'm afraid of,
but I'm pretty sure she is off him now for good."</p>

<p>"Yeah&mdash;and it's a shame. If she could only
have cared for that guy, even a little bit, she
would have been sitting pretty, but love is blind,
so they claim, so she falls for Harry, and he also
gets the Hell beat out of him. Well, it sure was
some fight."</p>

<p>A week passed, rather uneventful&mdash;the Mexican
trouble was settled and the border opened
again. Evelyn spent as much time as possible with
Pearl, accompanied by Mickey. Harry had already
left the hospital, and Pearl would be out in a few
days. The rest had done her good, and she gained
weight in those few days.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
"Has Harry been to see you today?" asked Evelyn.</p>

<p>"Sure, he was over to see me this morning. He
looks as good as ever, and he is so sweet. The
nurse told me I could leave here in the morning&mdash;ain't
that good news?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure glad, but what are you going to do
about Big Boy? You don't know it, but he has
damn near driven me crazy&mdash;he is wild to see you&mdash;he
knows Harry has been up here whenever
he wants to come, and he is wild with jealousy."</p>

<p>"Well, it's up to me to stay out of his way.
He knows where you live, and he can come up
there any time he wants to, so I'll have to stay
in a hotel so he can't come up. Won't you move
in with me for a while, Ev?"</p>

<p>"Sure, kid, I'll move in with you for a while.
I know how you feel and I'm kinda tired of that
apartment, anyhow. Let's move to the McCoy,
what do you say? I think you'll like it."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
"All right, Ev, you go pick out the room, so
I will have some place to go to in the morning."</p>

<p>"I'll go now, and do that before I go over on
the other side of the river. Good-bye, honey, I'll
see you in the morning," as she rose to go.</p>

<p>Pearl left the hospital, and went to the hotel,
where she found Evelyn in bed.</p>

<p>"I didn't expect you to be out so soon, or I
would have been down to meet you," said Evelyn,
as she raised up in the bed.</p>

<p>"I didn't know myself, but it's grand to be out
again and walk around&mdash;how is Juarez?"</p>

<p>"Just the same&mdash;I had a pretty good night last
night. Mickey picked a live guy for me, and I
got a hundred and ten bucks off him&mdash;that is,
Mickey put her hand in his pocket and took it
out and give it to me. She said I had earned the
money by being with him. You know Mickey,
and I just couldn't refuse&mdash;money is money."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
"See anything of Big Boy?"</p>

<p>"I was coming to that&mdash;I,&mdash;well, you will have
to be awful careful, honey&mdash;that guy is on a
drunk, and he is bad&mdash;he told me last night that
the first time he sees you he is going to shoot you.
I don't think he was kidding, either&mdash;he means
business. Then again he might just be bragging,
because he was so drunk&mdash;but just the same,
don't you think it would be best to kinda keep out
of sight for a few days?"</p>

<p>"Ah, gee, Ev, I wanted to go over tonight&mdash;couldn't
we go some place that he wouldn't think
to go, and that way we wouldn't be likely to run
into him. You must know of some place over
there we can go and drink and have a good time?"</p>

<p>"Sure, I know the very place, and I don't think
you have ever been there. It's one of the places
that Grace Valdez owns&mdash;you remember the old
girl I introduced you to&mdash;the one who owns the
Gold Palace. Well, this is her best money-making
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
place, so she says. It is a regular cabaret and bar,
with about thirty or forty girls working there,
and they have rooms upstairs&mdash;but lots of people
go there&mdash;sure, we will go over there tonight&mdash;what
do you say?"</p>

<p>"That's fine&mdash;I'm just raring to go on a good
one tonight&mdash;how about you?"</p>

<p>"I could start right now, as far as I'm concerned."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what let's do&mdash;you get up, and
let's go shopping. I need some new things, anyhow&mdash;will
you come?"</p>

<p>"Sure," answered Evelyn, as she climbed out
of bed.</p>

<p>They spent the day shopping, and went to a
show, then began to dress for the night over the
border. As they were leaving the hotel they ran
into Mickey.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
"Well, it sure is good to see you out and
around again Pearl&mdash;we sure have missed you."</p>

<p>"That's nice of you, Mickey."</p>

<p>"Hey, look Mickey," said Evelyn. "We're
going to the popular bar tonight&mdash;you know, the
one up that side street, off the Sixteenth of
September Street there&mdash;you know where it is,
don't you?"</p>

<p>"Sure, I know where that joint is&mdash;that's a
good idea&mdash;keep out of sight of the Big Boy,
especially till that louse gets over these fits of
jealousy."</p>

<p>This was too late&mdash;Big Boy was standing across
the street watching the three as they were talking
about him, eyes almost closed, watching Pearl
as a snake watches a bird.</p>

<p>As they moved down the street to catch the
car for Juarez, Big Boy followed. He boarded the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
car with them, but stayed in the back, with his
hat well over his face.</p>

<p>The night was beginning as they unloaded in
Juarez.</p>

<p>"Oh, Jees&mdash;&mdash;" said Evelyn, "don't look, but
there is Big Boy just getting off the rear of the
car&mdash;let's disappear pronto." They ran up the
block and into the darkness.</p>

<p>"Do you think he will suspect where we are
going?" asked Pearl.</p>

<p>"I don't think so. He will probably figure you
will make right for Harry, and that's where he
will go, and wait for you," reasoned Mickey as
they made their way on up the dimly lighted
street to the Popular Bar.</p>

<p>As they neared the Popular sounds of a tinkling
piano and drums, mixed with laughing and
singing, came to them. The place was crowded
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
with men who had not only come over for their
satisfaction of liquor, but to satisfy their baser
lusts as well&mdash;and this was the perfect place of
satisfaction of this sort. The girls were in short
dresses, heavily made up, with cheap rouge and
powder&mdash;they mixed with the men, hugging and
kissing whomever put their arms around them,
thinking only of the two dollars that could be
made upstairs.</p>

<p>"Jees, what a joint," exclaimed Pearl.</p>

<p>"You said it," answered Evelyn.</p>

<p>"Yeah&mdash;but you got a chance of making some
real money in this place&mdash;when these guys are
hugging any broad in the place you can always
get your hand in the pocket and he never knows
just who to blame," said Mickey as she looked
the place over for a prospect.</p>

<p>"Well, we might as well get to the bar and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
start sipping some of that joy water, don't you
think?" suggested Evelyn.</p>

<p>"Let's get at it," as they shoved their way
through the crowd.</p>

<p>"This place does the best business in town&mdash;at
least it looks that way," said Pearl.</p>

<p>"Well, they can get rougher and noisier, and
just anything goes, and this is some tough mob
in here right now."</p>

<p>"Where did Mickey go?" asked Pearl.</p>

<p>"Heaven only knows, but she must have
smelled a pocketbook&mdash;anyway, she will show up
in a minute&mdash;whiskey for me&mdash;what will you
have, honey?"</p>

<p>"Whiskey."</p>

<p>The music started in the cabaret, the crowd
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
shoved its way onto the dance floor, leaving the
bar partly empty. Big Boy stepped through the
swinging doors.</p>

<p>"Oh, God," whispered Pearl, "Big Boy."</p>

<p>There was no place to run, no time, nothing
to do but wait as Big Boy drew a service automatic
from his pocket, leveled it at Pearl, pulled
the trigger six times. Evelyn had stepped in front
of Pearl, taking the six bullets&mdash;she sank to the
floor, everything was silent&mdash;Pearl dropped to her
knees, lifting Evelyn's head.</p>

<p>"Oh, Ev, why did you do it&mdash;why did you do
it?" she cried in anguish.</p>

<p>The crowd had fought and shoved its way
back into the bar. Mickey knelt beside Pearl.</p>

<p>Evelyn slowly opened her eyes. "Don't cry,
kid, its best this way&mdash;you still have a chance&mdash;Mickey,
promise you will&mdash;" slowly her words
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
came, then a faint shudder, and her head fell forward.
Evelyn was no more. There is nothing
greater than to give one's life for that of a friend.
Evelyn had made the Great Gesture.</p>

<p>A shot was heard outside. People ran out to
see what it was. Pearl and Mickey looked at
each other.</p>

<p>"It's the guy that done this," said a man. "One
shot was all he needed to finish him, right through
the heart."</p>

<p>Six weeks since Evelyn had been buried. Pearl
had not been in Juarez since that night. Harry
had called up several times, but she had only seen
him once, and tonight the desire to see him was so
great she called up Mickey and made a date with
her to meet on the Mexican side and see Harry.
It wouldn't be the same without Evelyn, but she
still had Harry and he could always be depended
on&mdash;he loved her&mdash;she knew that.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
"Hello, darling," said Mickey as she put her
arms around Pearl. "You look a little peaked;
let's have a little drink and then we will go in
and see the floor show."</p>

<p>"All right," said Pearl, as she turned to the bar.</p>

<p>They had their drinks and found a table where
they could see Harry and the show. Pearl was
happy for the first time in weeks. She loved
Harry dearly; with him she could start all over
and face life on a different plane. He saw her
and waved, and soon he come over to them.</p>

<p>"Well, it's been some time since I've seen you&mdash;how
are you?" said Harry as he leaned over
the table.</p>

<p>"Fine, Harry, and you look wonderful."</p>

<p>"Listen, darling, you will have to excuse me
tonight&mdash;I won't be able to see you after the
show. I've got an engagement, about some
busi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>ness,
but I'll give you a ring in a day or so," as
he left the table.</p>

<p>Pearl looked at Mickey&mdash;Mickey looked at her
glass as she laid her hand over Pearl's.</p>

<p>"Forget it, kid, he's not worth it&mdash;have another
drink and let's get out of here."</p>

<p>Pearl couldn't speak. The thing she depended
on had been suddenly swept away from her. She
wanted to cry&mdash;she couldn't. She wanted to
scream&mdash;she couldn't do that. She was too numb
to even think much. Harry, who she had loved,
and whom she thought loved her, had given her
the cold freeze-out. She drank her whiskey&mdash;it
did no good&mdash;water would have had the same
effect now&mdash;nothing really mattered. She and
Mickey wandered from bar to bar until closing
time of the bridge.</p>

<p>"Do you want to come out to my place tonight,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
Pearl, honey? You are always welcome," asked
Mickey.</p>

<p>"I guess so," answered Pearl, "but let's go to
the State's Cafe before we go home&mdash;I want a
sandwich."</p>

<p>"Do you think it's best to go to the States,
dear?"</p>

<p>"Sure, I'll be all right."</p>

<p>"Let's go."</p>

<p>They arrived at the States at the height of the
merriment. The last of the crowd had gathered
there before going home with each other. Pearl
and Mickey came in. As they sat down, across
the aisle sat Harry and a little blonde who had
just come to town. He looked over to their table,
smiled and waved, and went on with his talk to
his partner.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
Pearl began to laugh&mdash;not a hysterical laugh,
but one filled with mirth. "Who in this Goddam
joint has a drink," she called as she rose from the
table. Several men rushed to her aid with open
bottles; she took a drink from them all, and so did
Mickey. She was gay, nothing mattered now&mdash;have
as much fun as possible. Ribald songs were
sung by her and the best of dirty stories came
to her mind. The crowd was so entertained it
wouldn't leave.</p>

<p>"Do you want to invite them all out to the
house?" whispered Mickey.</p>

<p>"Sure," answered Pearl. "Listen, gang&mdash;get
all your cars, and let's get going for a hell of a
good time out to Mickey's," as she jumped off the
table into the arms of the nearest man.</p>

<p>"Pearl, can't I see you for a minute?" asked
Harry as he pushed his way to her.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
"You have a business date to keep&mdash;now,
brother, you keep it. I fell for that line once, but
never again&mdash;Adios, Senor," as she went out the
door in the arms of the man for the night.</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
